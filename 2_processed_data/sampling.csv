DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,We should ban boxing because boxing is a blood sport and it's absolutely horrible for the athletes and it's a horrible message to send for society.,1,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,So why is this true?,2,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,The first big thing is that boxing has horrific consequences on the people who participate in it.,3,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,It's essentially like a modern day equivalent of gladiator battles in like the worse way possible.,4,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"In the short term you see things like concussions, you see things like bones breaking in people's face, someone's eyes can get like gouged out and damage from like from like hits.",5,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,There's all kinds of horrific injuries that people can obtain in the short term.,6,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,A lot of those injuries specifically can also of long term impacts.,7,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"Obviously you can suffer long term nerve damage, you can suffer brain damage from chronic hits.",8,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,This is a big problem in sports like boxing and also football where concussions and head trauma are common.,9,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,And this can result in essentially dementia like traits in a horribly young age.,10,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,Like dementia like traits in someone's forties or fifties or even younger sometimes.,11,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"You can see like permanent nerve damage, permanent eye damage, damage to your senses damage to your ability to like use your mouth to eat, because your face has been like parts of your face and your jaw have been broken so many times.",12,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"There's all kinds of horrible horrible consequences associated with boxing, even death.",13,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,For like hundreds or thousands of people that can often be the case.,14,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"And for the for the majority of boxers, not necessarily the ones who are the people you see on television as professional boxers, but amateur boxing, olympic boxing, youth boxing groups, oftentimes you can see severe health consequences for these people as well and there's going to be less healthcare for them.",15,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"There gonna be less help for them, less guidance for them to deal with the adverse consequences of boxing.",16,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"So really, this is absolutely horrible for a whole lot of people who participate in boxing, particularly at the lower levels of the sport, where they're just not going to get as much financial support for what they're putting their bodies through.",17,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"And beyond that, I also think boxing has really horrible social consequences.",18,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"Because as a society, when we try to tell people like "" violence isn't the answer "" or "" we should try to strive for like peaceful resolutions to conflict "", it's a really mixed signal when you're at the same time glorifying the violence in its purest form.",19,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"When you think that, like punching someone in the face so hard that they bleed so much, that they're in pain, so much that they get knocked out to the ground and they get a concussion from it, that we glorify that as sport, that we look at that as entertainment.",20,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"I think says a lot about the innate violence, the innate horrible values that we hold as a society.",21,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,And that's really not something that we should be proud of.,22,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,It's not something that we should put on a pedestal.,23,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"We shouldn't violence like that on a pedestal, and we shouldn't try to appreciate violence from that.",24,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"When we like when the people who like commit these like violent actions get paid millions of dollars for what they do, and we look at that as entertainment, it gives a horrible message that we don't actually value peace, we don't actually value like things like that.",25,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,"We overwhelmingly value blood we and violence, and that's I think a really horrible message to send as a society.",26,,
DJ_121_ban-boxing_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons ban boxing.,27,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,We should keep three strikes laws for a few big reasons.,1,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"First, because these crimes are incredibly bad crimes even if they're perceived as minor felonies, and they're ones that we need to deter.",2,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"And I think that in addition to the fact these are bad and we need to deter people from doing them, I think that when people commit crimes over and over again, there is no reason to believe why they won't keep doing it, so you need to protect the population from these people.",3,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about these kinds of things.",4,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"I think that it's important to first start with an overview, that the reason why we punish people when we we give people prison sentences isn't just to punish people.",5,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"If you murder someone, we're not putting you in prison just because you deserve a punishment for doing a bad thing.",6,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"We're also doing we also have laws in place because we don't want people to do these things in the first place, and because we want people who are willing to do these kind of things to stay away from the rest of society, to not be able to murder or hurt more people.",7,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"So, that's what this is going to be about, about deterrence and about isolation of people for protection.",8,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"So, let's first start by talking about deterrence.",9,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"I think that it's important to note that these crimes are oftentimes bad harms, and that there's never really a victimless crime.",10,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"Even if it's seen as like a minor felony, and you're just getting a long prison sentence for in accumulation of minor felonies, minor felony can be things like minor theft of things, so like someone's computer or like robbing a store.",11,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"It could mean minor it could be like minor instances of assault, where you like you like abuse several women, or like your girlfriend a couple of like at various points in time.",12,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"These are things that are still severe in my opinion, and these are things that are worthy of being punished.",13,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"I think that, therefore, you want to stop people from doing these things, and I think that the best way to do that is by a greater deterrence threat, because when there's a perceived lack of importance given to, like, the severity of these crimes, that is because of the fact that they're associated with only small, minor prison sentences, possibly for felony.",14,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"it could just be probation or things like that, or parole or whatever.",15,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"And I think that, therefore, when you say if you keep doing something you're going to be punished for twenty five years to life in prison, it says that the accumulation of keep doing these felonies over and over again does not suggest that it could be tolerated, and I think that people are going to be less likely to commit these crimes",16,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,because they're going to have greater punishment associated with them,17,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,People are going to recognize and internalize the consequences of these so called minor felonies that they're committing.,18,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,But I also think that this is important as far as isolating people and protecting the population.,19,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"It's important to note that if someone commits the same crime or a similar crime or a similar felony three times, there's no reason to really believe why they're not just going to keep doing this t- crime over and over again.",20,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"Like if you get caught doing a bad thing three times, I don't understand why they wouldn't do it a fourth time or a fifth time, and this is bad because this because every additional time is another person that's getting assaulted, another person that's getting stolen from.",21,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,These are things that the government has an obligation to stop and an obligation to protect people from.,22,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"And I think that that's therefore a very logical grounds to put someone in prison longer, if you can't trust that person to not keep stealing, to not keep hurting people, then they should be imprisoned for a longer amount of time.",23,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"And you're by isolating this person from the rest of the population, it means that they can't steal from someone a fourth time or a fifth time.",24,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"So, three strikes laws help people doing that, and they make sure that the people are actually protected better.",25,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"And for all those reasons, we should definitely keep three strikes laws.",26,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,We should not further exploit nuclear power and we shouldn't exploit it further,1,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"because, while nuclear power is arguably in at some cases, better than some of our current energy uses, like fossil fuels, I don't think that it's better than green energy as far as the comparative is concerned, and I think that further exploitation, especially if it's going to happen right now, should be largely focused on green energy, and there's necessarily a trade off in terms of resources for investment",2,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,If you were to invest in nuclear power that will come at the expense of green energy.,3,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So let's talk about those two things.,4,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"First, why green energy is better than nuclear power and secondarily, why there's going to be a trade off between the two that's bad.",5,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So first, why is green energy better?",6,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So I think that first and foremost it's safer.,7,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Green energy they first and most obviously can't be weaponized.,8,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,You're not going to be able to weaponize the wind or solar energy.,9,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So whenever states try to come up with excuses like oh well we need to have this nuclear factory for peaceful purposes or whatever, well now that's not an excuse anymore because you don't really need nuclear power because green energy could be a thing.",10,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"But additional it is also risks of meltdowns and while meltdowns aren't all that common in the status quo and not they don't happen all that often, there's two problems.",11,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"First, when they do happen they're quite severe.",12,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So if you think that, for example, like things like like- I think it's like six mile island or whatever in america, or chernobyl in like russia or ukraine, you look at the fukushima disaster in japan, these things have made entire areas essentially unlivable and because of global radiation spread through things like the wind.",13,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"whenever there's like nuclear fallout from a meltdown, these things have big consequences.",14,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"but additionally, also when you're upping the scale of production, that's also going to add in more risk.",15,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"Especially now when you have a lot more environmental volatility, in a global warming era, when there's a lot more natural dis- asters.",16,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"but I think that, additionally, it's also going to be, in the long term, better from a an environmental perspective, in a cost perspective, because there's always going to be some kind of green energy alternative, like there's probably very few places on earth that don't either have running water that you can use for hydroelectric power, wind that you can use for wind energy or sunlight.",17,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"If a place doesn't have water, doesn't have wind, doesn't have like a lot of sunlight, it's very difficult to find a place on earth that meets all of these criteria.",18,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"so, or example, maybe massachusetts isn't that sunny, but it's very windy.",19,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"maybe somewhere like texas or israel is a lot more sunny, even if it doesn't have as much, say, like running water or things like that.",20,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So there is those arguments but I also think that as far as cost is concerned uranium is you have to set up the factory, you have to put in a whole lot of cautions on the factories for like nuclear factories, you have to mine uranium.",21,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Uranium is a whole lot rare and more expensive.,22,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So all of these things are also on the cost terms if you're going to exploit something or invest in something more on the cost terms it's probably going to be better to and cheaper and more versatile in the long run to use green energy.,23,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"And this is a problem because, in terms of absolute, absolute terms, there's going to be limited resources as far as what you invest in, so the government just isn't going to be able to invest in everything that you want to.",24,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"but also, on, like, the political level, there's always going to be political checks that you are going to make, so that the government's never going to be able to spend all the money on things.",25,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So if you're further exploiting nuclear power as your energy source once you see your energy needs are satiated you're probably not going to be is likely to want to invest even more money into other things like green energy when they're not seen as necessary because you already have nuclear power.,26,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So I think that for all those reasons, we should not further exploit nuclear power.",27,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"We absolutely should not ban gambling because it won't work first of all, and secondarily, there's nothing really wrong with gambling.",1,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"It should be fine, it should be legal if people want to do it.",2,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about why banning gambling will not work at all.",3,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"So, the point of banning something, presumably, is you want to deter people from doing it because you think it has some kind of harm or problem.",4,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"So, this has an assumption and the assumption is that the ban itself is actually going to deter people from the activity in the first place, that is gambling.",5,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,So that's not going to happen.,6,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,and it's not going to happen because people have been gambling for thousands of years.,7,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,it's a pretty ingrained part of our culture.,8,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,we have entire cities dedicated to it.,9,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"you know like there's gambling in las vegas, obviously.",10,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,I'm pretty sure there's a lot of gambling in places like eilat in israel as well.,11,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,there's all kinds of like.,12,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,a lot of cities have these as their industries and things like that.,13,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,So there's problems with this.,14,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"So, first and foremost a problem is that you're going to see a whole whole lot of resistance from the people who are involved in the gambling industry, a whole lot of resistance about the cities and livelihoods that are being destroyed, and a whole lot of resistance to all of these kinds of policies and bans in the first place.",15,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"But second and more importantly, it's completely unenforceable, because you can just gamble on the internet in.",16,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"there's nothing really the government can do to regulate it, because oftentimes the websites can be set up in like different countries, or you can, even if, like the websites are under like any kind of certain set of laws.",17,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"you're there's always ways that you can use the internet to avoid government detection and I highly doubt that the government is going to dedicate like legit military and hacking and all kinds of technical and physical and monetary resources to really cracking down gambling, and if it wanted to do that, it would cost like billions, if not probably like like",18,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"so many billions of dollars that it would be a complete waste of time, since people are largely going to do it on the internet anyway",19,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"And that's obviously a problem because first and foremost, you're not making the money off of gambling anymore, you can't tax gambling, you can't profit off of it, so a lot of money in revenue is going away.",20,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"Additionally when you ban something then it becomes a part of a black market, it's more likely to be unsafe, you're more likely going to have like crime lords and people like that presiding over the factors.",21,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"And additionally you also can't have things like consumer protection laws in place, so you can't really enforce things to make sure that like, obviously gambling is random and to a large extent and things like that, but enforcement to make sure that like you aren't being as a gambler like completely screwed over by the people like the house per se, so that's important as well.",22,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"So gambling is probably going to happen anyway, might as well happen safer, more profitably, and more effectively if you just regulate it rather than ban it.",23,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"But I also think that there's nothing wrong with th- gambling and it's rather immoral to ban it in the first place, because keep in mind that when people are gambling, they're usually gambling with their own money.",24,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"if they're gambling with someone else's money, we call them wall street bankers.",25,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"so they're usually gambling with their own money, not other people's.",26,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,so that's money that you've earned.,27,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,that's money that you can do what you want with.,28,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"you should have the right to spend your money in the way you want, because you work for it.",29,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"But additionally, gambling doesn't harm anyone.",30,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"it's not like I- gambling doesn't really harm people like any kind of vague things like crime or whatever l- like maybe vaguely associated with gambling is problematic, that's usually only because the other things, like drugs or prostitution or whatever, are illegal in the first place.",31,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"maybe that should be illegal too, but also keep in mind that, like the black market argument that I made about how that's not going to be solved anyway.",32,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"so, other than maybe like the vague facilitation of crime, there's no real reason why gambling itself is all that bad, why you shouldn't be able to spend your money that you earned that way, if you want.",33,,
DJ_221_ban-gambling_con_opening_YBA.trs.txt,"So for those reasons, we should not ban gambling.",34,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,We should not abolish the right to keep and bear firearms because guns can be important for self defense and also sport for some people.,1,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what we would support.,2,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,Because abolishing the right to keep and have firearms would would mean that pretty much all guns can be banned and regulated.,3,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"And I think that there's a much more reasonable common ground, where you can ban things like automatic and semi automatic weapons, you can ban things like assault rifles.",4,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,Our you can also regulate th- access much more strictly.,5,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"You can have a universal background checks, you can maybe like tax guns, require gun insurance, make like all kinds of restrictions and regulations that are put in place that will I make it so that guns are less likely to fall into the wrong people's hands and that guns are less likely to be abused and they are more likely to be safe.",6,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,But that doesn't mean that guns are all inherently bad.,7,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,So there's a couple of things here: so the first of which is that there is a self defense concern that is here.,8,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"Guns are incredibly prominent in america, and regardless of whether or not you legally allow people to have guns, there's already millions and millions of guns that are already in existence.",9,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"So in order to make sure that people are able to protect themselves possibly, able to use self defense, you want at least some people who are trained to have guns besides police officers who may not be able to get there in time.",10,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"Because if there's a civilian has a gun who is being attacked or sees somebody being attacked, then maybe they're able to do something about it.",11,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,That could be like a really good legitimate and valid use for a gun.,12,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,So guns can have like they can definitely serve a purpose.,13,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,But beyond that I also think that guns can be useful for sport.,14,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,A whole lot of people compete in things.,15,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"Like whether it's like rifling or target practice, you just go to a shooting range for the fun of it, or maybe like deer are over populating some area so you're able to hunt some deer, or something like that.",16,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,Things that already are legitimate in allowable and happen right now.,17,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"This is like an important thing that some people do, that some people have fun with and that's a choice some people make.",18,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,And it doesn't really hurt anyone.,19,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,It doesn't really hurt anyone that people go to like a shooting range or hunt some overpopulated deer or something like that.,20,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,These are like perfectly legitimate pastimes.,21,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"And in like a liberal society, in a democratic society you should make it so that people are able to like just do what they wanna do.",22,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"But the final thing, the final argument is that this is this right has really important historical roots in a check against in in a check against oppression in a lot of ways.",23,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,The government has like a whole lot of ability to use force and it can do a lot of stuff to you that could necessarily be bad.,24,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"So the ability of people to like keep firearms, keep their own independent sources of power and weaponry, if they need to, and the whatever, can be something that could be useful like for a variety of reasons in the instance that there's oppression.",25,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"This debate isn't just taking place in the united states, it's abolishing rights to have guns wherever these guns may exist it seems.",26,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,"So in circumstances where maybe you need it for safety not just from other individuals, but from even state or more organized actors, guns can obviously serve a role and a purpose.",27,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_opening_SSH.trs.txt,So for all those reasons don't abolish rights to have firearms.,28,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,We should not limit the right of self defense.,1,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,And we shouldn't limit the right of self defense because other people and most certainly not the state should be able to tell you how what is the best way and to keep you safe.,2,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,What is the most effective way when your life is in danger to secure your life?,3,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,Obviously a freedom that you have.,4,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"So here's the problem: when we talk about things when we talk more like precisely about what a limiting to the right of defense would look like, it would mean maybe things like a duty to flee, so like you try to escape first, duties to deescalate, maybe shooting to like hinder rather than kill, things like this.",5,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"And these things obviously can sound somewhat reasonable on its face, obviously you don't wanna like give someone like a roadside execution, if they're like doing petty robbery, but you think your life is in danger.",6,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"Because obviously there's still things like rights to trial, proportionate punishment, things like this, and these are important things.",7,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,But the thing to keep in mind is that nothing is more important than your own safety and your life.,8,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"Because at the worst case scenario is the like the harm is that the person who is initiating the attack in the first place is going to die, but that's no greater of a consequence than the extreme on the other end, which is that you would die.",9,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,So you're making a choice between the two.,10,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"You want to pick between the you want to pick a person who isn't doing anything wrong and who should have this right to self defense in the first place, so that they can like just live their life really.",11,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"And the problem is that I don't really think that a lot of the standards that would be put on, or the limits on a right to self defense would be all that fairly applied.",12,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"Because it's very easy to say , especially after the fact, when you're maybe putting somebody on trial for like wrong- using wrongful self defense or you're investigating something after the fact.",13,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"It's very easy to, after the fact say: "" well, in my situation, from where I am, you could have ran.",14,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"You could have done this this or that "".",15,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"But the problem is that when your life is in danger, when somebody is maybe attacking you and you don't know if they have a knife on them or a gun on them, when somebody pulls out a gun and you don't know whether or not they're actually willing to shoot, you are not.",16,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"when somebody is attacking maybe somebody else, there is an incredibly high degree of risk, fear and uncertainty in these situations.",17,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"And it's not really sufficient to say: "" oh well this person could have fled. """,18,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"But they don't know that, for example, the person attacking you could be like: "" well, this person's gonna flee and get help and then I'm gonna be in trouble. """,19,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"So they may be able do it like, they could attack you or things like that.",20,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,Maybe then they could get away.,21,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"And maybe if they stole something like significant from you, that's like really really bad for you and the police isn't going to be able to really do all that much.",22,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,And that's besides the point that it's not like the police is necessarily going to be any more careful with another person's life anyway.,23,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,So I don't even think it necessarily the assumption that creating limits on self defense is necessarily even going to decrease casualties given how careless police can often be with the lives of others.,24,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,"So I'm not necessarily sure what exactly you can do to make the situation a whole lot better, but certainly you can't just limit people's rights to self defense when ultimately innocent people are gonna be put in danger the most as a result of that.",25,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_opening_WS.trs.txt,So for those reasons don't limit self-defense rights.,26,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,We should not fight it.,1,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,In fact we should incentivize it.,2,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,The first big reason why urbanization is great is that it's necessary and good for the future of jobs and economic organization.,3,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So obviously a lot of a suburban and rural jobs are going away or becoming more automated.,4,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,You don't need that many people to be farmers.,5,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,A lot of factories are being shifted overseas or largely becoming automated anyway.,6,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Suburban retail industries are getting gutted and destroyed and things like that.,7,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,By and large economics are centered around cities and this is going to only continue and accelerate as life goes on.,8,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So as a result you want to make sure that you're going to keep having the resources to combat this trend anyway because this is an inevitable trend that you can't really fight.,9,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,You can't force your way out of automate automation.,10,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,You can't force your way back into like a more agrarian or space oriented economy.,11,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,When everything goes towards more when a as like the societies develop you go towards more specialized centers which is what cities can provide to you.,12,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But additionally cities are great as far as more efficient resource allocation which is also something that's very important.,13,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So if you want to provide things like a hospital services or could be like police and fire services or like electricity grids and things like that, all these things can be much more easily provided when they're in concentrated locations, when you don't have to spend.",14,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"but first of all, like the time distance between going places, obviously, but also like setting up large like swaths of transportations, possibly like long distances and further, because of like economics of scale, you can serve a lot more people with more specialized services.",15,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,that could be a lot more helpful to people.,16,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So that's obviously a thing that's very good as well.,17,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But additionally you can also do things like more easily provide for people when you can serve a larger group of people at once.,18,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So if you want to do things like subsidized housing it's a lot easier to do it rather than creating a lot of small areas on plots of land create one taller building which has like less land area it takes up except fulling all.,19,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Things like that so urbanization is really good in that.,20,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Urbanization's also really good for the environment though which is very important because whether it's obviously the reduced transportation footprint because if you live in a city you're less likely you drive everywhere and things like that.,21,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,You can be more likely to rely on public transportation or a bike or other alternatives.,22,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,That's huge because the automobile is a very is obviously a very big reason for behind pollution.,23,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But additionally when you're more concentrated you're gonna have like less habitat destruction less just like destroying to create long endless swaths of land where you need space and pavement and all those kinds of things.,24,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So it's a lot better for the environment to and responsible development as well.,25,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But finally we shouldn't invite we shouldn't fight urbanization because fighting urbanization is fighting the reasonable preferences that people have.,26,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,People wanna live in cities because it can be more fun.,27,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,You have more access to entertainment opportunities.,28,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,There is a whole lot more to do in cities that makes them a whole lot more appealing and enjoyable especially in a future society.,29,,
DJ_3199_urbanization_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should not fight urbanization.,30,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,We should not abandon online dating because online dating is great for a whole lot of people and a lot of people enjoy it.,1,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why online dating works for a lot of people.,2,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Because through traditional ways in which you meet people or without the internet or without any kind of online platform to connect with people, your meeting with people in the real world and that's something that a lot of people don't always want to do.",3,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,A lot of people don't enjoy going to bars.,4,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,A lot of people don't enjoy going to clubs.,5,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,A lot of people don't actively want to just go out into the and meet with a bunch of strangers in a place that they don't know or a place they may not be as comfortable.,6,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,A lot of people just don't like that and that's for good reasons.,7,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And especially when you're talking about having like a relationship with somebody, you're dating somebody, these are probably pretty important things.",8,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"If you're the kind of person who doesn't like going to clubs, your pr- you may, your probably going to the people that you may meet in clubs and things like that may not be the kind of people that you actually want to date.",9,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,And online dating can provide a pretty good solution for that.,10,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Because there's so many people, because you get an alternative platform to meet people and because it creates, like, essentially, a profile where you can learn a couple of things about someone- their basic personality, traits and things like that- before you actually meeting with someone or before you're even talking to somebody.",11,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"it gives you more of a grounding idea of what you're actually going to know about this person, rather than just seeing somebody in the club or something like that.",12,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So I think that's a lot better.,13,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,But it's also good in terms of access.,14,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Because a lot of people are like awkward, or you're just not comfortable going up to somebody in a club or in a bar and talking to somebody.",15,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And a lot of online dating gives more of a solves a lot of these problems by first just sheer level of access to a lot of people, some of whom are going to be much more similar to you, and second by like matching you with a person.",16,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So you're already going to have a basis of things to discuss.,17,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,A basis of similarity which is also helpful.,18,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And a lot of those things are probably going to make your dating experience enjoyable, they're probably going to make your dating experience better, which is all good things.",19,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,The next thing that I want to talk about though is that I think that this is also probably helpful in terms of like safety in terms of dating.,20,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Because, like I said, when the alternative is you're meeting people in a club or at a bar or something like that and outside, the first time that you're meeting somebody, you're meeting somebody in possibly an unfamiliar space and it's somebody that you really don't know, you know almost nothing about, while when it's, when it's online dating, you don't have to meet somebody ever.",21,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"if you do meet them at, you don't have to meet them ever.",22,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And if you do meet someone it's only going to be by choice, after sufficient discussion with somebody via like a digital connection.",23,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So there's less of an ability to harm somebody.,24,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And you're more likely to feel comfortable with that person because you've already talked to that person for a while, you probably know a little bit more about that person and you take more time to like get to know somebody.",25,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So I think that it's probably good on the safety front too.,26,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should not abandon online dating.",27,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,We should not fight for palestinian independence because palestinian independence would necessarily come at the expense of israeli security and israelis viability is a state and it would also require unseemly and unnecessary sacrifices on the part of israel.,1,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"So let's start by grounding this a little bit and talking about why in general israel is clearly in the right in the palestinian israeli conflict and therefore it shouldn't really make any concessions that are unnecessary in terms of its security or in terms of concessions like say giving up east jerusalem, the right of return or etcetera etcetera.",2,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So the biggest reason is that palestinians have had numerous opportunities to come to the negotiating table and have peace with israelis.,3,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And this has been the case throughout many many decades, where you start from the very first when the UN proclamation that created the separations of palestine in israel.",4,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Palestine had way more land than israel did, to the point where israel wasn't even a continuous state.",5,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,It had to separate parts.,6,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And then that wasn't good enough for palestine and like eight other arab countries, so they decided to invade israel.",7,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And lo and behold, israel wins that war, and then you fast forward over the next forty years or so and though every decade or so, whether it's on a jewish holiday in yom kippur or in like the middle of june, arab countries in palestinian allies decide to invade israel every once in a while and they kept losing.",8,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,And it's pretty much their their fault that they're in the situation that they're in right now.,9,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,They kept trying to take more more land from israel.,10,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,Throughout most of the history of the conflict palestinian leaders weren't even willing to accept israel's right to exist as a state.,11,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"It wasn't until the oslo accords in like the nineties when yasser arafat gave up that concession, the concession of israel literal existence.",12,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So realistically our sympathy should be limited.,13,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So now let's talk about why israel's israeli sacrifices.,14,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"So fighting for a palestinian independence would be really bad for advancing israeli causes, which is bad because they're in the right.",15,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So first it would be a security hazard for israel.,16,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,The biggest reason and the obvious reason is that this would just give hamas the ability to basically do whatever the hell it wanted in the gaza strip.,17,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Like if palestine is its own state, you are not gonna have a blockade on it.",18,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,that would be like an act of war.,19,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"so, unless you're gonna perpetually be at war with the newly independent state- which seem like a pointless and stupid idea and like bes- like against the purposes of giving them statehood in the first place- then like you have to do all tons of stuff like lifting blockades, lifting restrictions, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.",20,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So you're probably not gonna be very good for israeli security.,21,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Like if you think like iran and turkey and saudi arabia and whoever trying to like ship weapons into like various palestinian terrorist organizations now, well just wait till what happens when israel has a nonexistent security presence in those parts.",22,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So like there's probably not gonna be all that much there and that's gonna be really bad.,23,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"But it's further bad because it legitimizes that acts of terrorism, literally the murder of civilians is a legitimate way to extract concessions from a state, which is ridiculous.",24,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,Like they would be like saying that like nine eleven when it happened to america is like legitimate grounds for america start giving concessions to like al qaida or the taliban or whatever.,25,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,It's just like it's absolutely ridiculous.,26,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,But the final thing is that it would be unfair concessions on the part of israel and what they would have to give up.,27,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,Palestinians are asking for too much.,28,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"They're demanding like a right of return, they are demanding east jerusalem, they're demanding millions of settlements beat dismantled, most if not all of which are pretty much unreasonable.",29,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So for all those reasons don't fight for palestinian independence.,30,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,We should not limit the internet of things because the internet of things is generally really good.,1,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,It makes people's lives easier and at that it's a choice that people make.,2,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So and it's a legitimate choice so you should limit people's choice.,3,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why the internet of things is just and actively good thing.,4,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,And I think that the reasons for this are very obvious.,5,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,The reason why these technologies are being invented in the first place and like millions and millions of dollars is being invested into these new market products is that people think that it's gonna be useful.,6,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,People think it's going to be useful to have technology and the internet integrating everything from your car to your refrigerator to your watch to your phone to your TV.,7,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"And it's true, these things do make everything easier.",8,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Like are really basic example is I want to watch TV I want to watch like some kind of basketball game on my TV.,9,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"But since I'm a young millennial and I don't pay for cable because cable is stupid, I want to just like get individual things that I want that I can watch on the internet, which is oftentimes free.",10,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So how do I get that on to my TV?,11,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"Well, if you have like a smart TV you could just like go on the internet on your TV.",12,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Or same if you have like a playstation or something like that.,13,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"Or similarly, if you have like a car, especially in the future when we are self driving cars, and you're going to need to integrate things like say google maps navigation maybe, other kinds of things, there's all kinds of ways in which like your life can just be made easier by the existence of the internet of things.",14,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"When like all of these things are connected, when you're not like constantly log in and out of every individual advice, when you can like communicate with different advices, when if you're doing something on your phone and then suddenly you wanna like do something on your computer, like those things are gonna be connected.",15,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So like it's like the same concept with like something like google drive, where if you're like editing something in one location you don't wanna have to like be back in the old days where you need like to just like email everything and upload it and then download it, now you can just like do it on the cloud.",16,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Like things like that which just like generally make your life easier and much better.,17,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So all of that's going to be great.,18,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But the additional layer of argument here is that people make choices as to partake in the internet of things.,19,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,People do not have to like obviously in many cases the internet isn't really optional nowadays.,20,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"Like you have to use things like email at work, you realistically if you wanna like a find things in general you probably need to use the internet.",21,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But the internet of things itself as like in a as an entire entity is definitely not mandatory.,22,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Like there's definitely many things that you don't have to participate in.,23,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,If you don't wanna have like a smart refrigerator then just don't get a smart refrigerator.,24,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,If you don't want a smart TV?,25,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Don't get a smart TV.,26,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"If you don't want an apple watch then just don't, then get like a regular watch.",27,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,There's all kinds of ways in which like it's obvious that like you don't have t- it's not like coercive in the same way that th- internet access general is.,28,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So like any risks or any problems that may arise from the internet of things, whether it's like dependency or security or anything like that, it's important to recognize that these are all by choice, and that people can just like: "" wait, well this may have some kind of risk but it makes my life easier in this other way. """,29,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,And that's a choice that people are perfectly capable and rational of making.,30,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should not limit the internet of things.,31,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"We should not end international aid because international aid is incredibly important on a moral level, on a political level, and it doesn't come with that many costs so it's definitely worth it.",1,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why international aid is so important and I think that the biggest way is that honestly I think to some extent there's a moral obligation to give out international aid.,2,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,When you look around the world you see a lot of people who are a lot less fortunate than than countries than people who live in a place like america.,3,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,You see around the world people who live off of like our dollars dollars a day compared to what people in america live off of.,4,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"You see widespread food insecurity, you see not a whole lot of health and health infrastructure a lack of safety in a lot of contexts and things like that.",5,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,And one of the biggest ways in which you can solve a lot of these problems is money because money is important.,6,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"Money can buy clean drink you can buy clean drinking water with money, you can buy like malaria nets with money, you can buy food and shelter with money.",7,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,International aid can be incredibly important and a tool for good to solve a lot of problems that people have on a day-to-day basis.,8,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,So obviously it can do a whole lot of good.,9,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,So why should we feel an obligation to do that?,10,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"And the big reason there is that a lot of countries are first in situations like this because of developed countries or western countries having, like, a legacy of imperialism and colonialism that led to taking advantage of this.",11,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"whether it was the literal, like stripping land of resources and enslaving, enslavement of people, that led to the current global order that we see today, where western countries have a disproportionate control over resources and a disproportionate control over wealth, or whether it was like using intergovernmental financing agencies, whether it was the world trade organization or the IMF or similar entity, the world bank, in order to essentially force developing countries to accommodate western corporations to the largest extent possible,",12,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,so that western corporations could enrich themselves in their home countries while doing minimal good for the people who actually live in these countries and where the resources actually are,13,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,I feel like to a large extent the reason why there's a lot of problems in the world is because of the actions that were taken by western countries so they definitely should be giving aid almost as a form of reparations to help prevent that.,14,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,But I also think that on a political level this is simply just a good thing to do.,15,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"Nothing builds up political will better, nothing makes the people on the ground happier and more willing to cooperate with you, than to help them solve the problems financially.",16,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"When you look at the way things are now in the world, the reason why we have such a strong alliance with countries throughout europe- a strong alliance with places like japan, a strong alliance with other countries- that we obviously bomb the crap out of them during world war two, completely burn down most of their cities.",17,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,why don't these countries hate us?,18,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"because, after we did that, we help them rebuild, we gave them large amounts of international aid, whether it's the marshall plan or similar plans- and what this did is it resulted in a progression of these countries economies.",19,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"and when you look at places nowadays- whether it's places in africa or, more prominently, places in the middle east that we've bombed- you look at these places that we're not giving them a level of help, so we're not doing a whole lot in order to make their lives better.",20,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,so I think that's a clear problem there.,21,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,And I think that we can see a lot of problems get solved and a lot of political goodwill being brought up if this were to be implemented.,22,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,But finally I think that this is really cheap.,23,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"It's really cheap because it's it's just not that big of a part of our budget whether it's whe- when you compare it to things like our military budget, our domestic healthcare spending budget, or things like that, the amount of money that gets spent on international aid is pennies on the dollar really not a whole lot of money.",24,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,So a lot of these benefits can be for low amounts of money so it's definitely worth it.,25,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_opening_RG.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, do not end international aid.",26,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,We should not ban fishing because banning fishing would be very detrimental to a lot of people's health and people should be able to eat fish if they want to.,1,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what exactly we have to defend.,2,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"Because we don't necessarily have to defend a world where you can just do whatever you want in the ocean, a world without regulation, obviously anything that goes short of a ban.",3,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So maybe you can put caps on the degree, on the numbers of fish that you can catch in the wild, so maybe if you're like concerned about like atlantic salmon levels or maine lobsters or something like that you can put a limit on the degree to which you can harvest them.",4,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"You can also maybe put more requirements in place on locations, maybe establishing more marine wildlife refuges that restrict locations where you can finish.",5,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But all of these things do not necessarily can be like or rather can be effective enough to combat a possible problems so that a ban isn't really necessary and a ban would actually be going to far.,6,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So let's start by talking about why people should just eat fish often, especially fish in the wild.",7,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Obviously fish can be very good for you.,8,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,There's several benefits of fish.,9,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,First and most notably fish can have a lot of nutrients that are good for you.,10,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"Nutrients like omega three fish oils, things that could be good for your health in a lot of ways.",11,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But moreover fish can also supplement your diet in terms that it's lower fat protein that can therefore be good for all the reasons we need proteins to survive.,12,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So you have fish like tuna which are much better than the alternative, especially on a comparative basis.",13,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So if people are getting their protein from tuna instead of from say cows, not only is that just healthier for the person because it's lower fat more nutrient rich protein consumption, but it also oftentimes has a less detrimental impact on the environment.",14,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"Because even if over fishing is a problem and fishing from the wild is imperfect way of getting protein, when you look at it in the comparative we would probably rather people eat tuna then cows, given that it's like less resource intensive, it requires less like water less energy less feed, less , so all less of an ecological footprint.",15,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"But moreover, even if that comparison isn't as apt, you still have to talk about what the comparison would be, which is factory farmed fish verses wild caught fish.",16,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,And obviously while caught fish are a whole lot better for you.,17,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"Oftentimes factory farmed fish can have a myriad of chemicals in them, oftentimes are used various growth hormones to speed up reproductive cycles and to speed up growth cycles, which can result in sometimes alarming impacts.",18,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Whether it's alarming levels of mercury that you can see in fish or even impacts that like growth hormones could have on humans.,19,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But moreover people should just be able to eat fish if they want to.,20,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Oftentimes this is a matter of convenience.,21,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,A lot of areas it just makes more sense to eat fish.,22,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"If you like live in the bahamas or something like that, it's probably easier to catch fish for your diet than it is to like get cows.",23,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Just based on like access to food resources.,24,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Like maybe it doesn't make as much sense if you live in iowa but if you live in maine it's probably better to like get more protein from lobsters or fish than it is like fly in steaks from omaha or something like that.,25,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So oftentimes access can play key role here especially when you're talking about developing countries.,26,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But moreover fish is just tasty.,27,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"Fish taste good and people should be able to eat things in general if they taste good, especially given the that regulations can solve in a lot of instances.",28,,
DJ_3658_fishing_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should not ban fishing.,29,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,We should not ban reality tv because doing so is an obvious violation of freedom of speech and freedom of expression.,1,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,And beyond that it's also an incredibly ridiculous idea.,2,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why this is just illegal and it's a violation of free speech and expression.,3,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,And there's a couple of reasons for this: and first it's because this is self expression is an incredibly important form of protected speech in terms of like constitutional law and there's reasons for that.,4,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,Speech doesn't have to be political to have value.,5,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Speech can be important culturally, artistically, etcetera.",6,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,And that's important because there's more to life and there is more to things that are valuable than just simply politics.,7,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And oftentimes these things are intertwined with one another anyway, because the way in which we express ourselves in a non neutral way in a public setting via like a TV show or something like that, is an important way in which we express who we are and express our identities and that's obviously an incredibly important thing to individual people.",8,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,So that's why we have protections in place for things like that.,9,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"But beyond that, I also think that this is just an illegal action.",10,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Because this is clearly content based like targeted discrimination, amongst like a particular group.",11,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"So when you're trying to like like one of the biggest no no's in terms of freedom of speech is basically the government or the state, as like a ba- when they're trying to ban speech, doesn't get to just pick and choose what speech it likes and what speech it doesn't like.",12,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Because it basically gives rise to like the definition of prejudice in that the government gets to decide what the narrative is, the government gets to decide what's acceptable for a population to listen to, and that's absolutely ridiculous because that's not how it should work.",13,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,The people get to decide what they want to hear.,14,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,And if you don't want to listen to something then you just turn it off or you block it or something like that.,15,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"But that doesn't mean that something shouldn't be accessible to people who want to see it, who wants to enjoy it.",16,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And that goes into the final thing that I'm going to talk about, which is why this is just an absolutely ridiculous thing.",17,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,And the first thing is that this is going to piss off a lot of people because a lot of people like reality TV and for good reason.,18,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Reality TV isn't merely the scapegoat of like jersey shores, something like that, where it's seen as just like a plague on our society in terms of like stupidity.",19,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,It's an incredibly diverse area and there's like a huge niches to it.,20,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Like you could have like like rupaul's drag race, you could have like cutthroat kitchen, like you have like skin wars, you have obviously things like the jersey shore too.",21,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,Like there's literally endless ways of reality TV shows.,22,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,And a lot of different people get different kinds of pleasure out of it because it's such a diverse genre.,23,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And just trying to say as like a blanket: "" all reality TV is bad.",24,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"All reality TV is worthy of the same condemnation. """,25,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,Because it's an incredibly diverse genre that a whole lot of people enjoy.,26,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"And that goes into the last thing, which is that this isn't going to solve anything.",27,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"Any argument against reality TV, that you could be doing something else that's more productive, that it that it's actively bad because it's like a drain on like society's brains or something like that, there's always going to be some kind of alternative that's just as bad if not worse.",28,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,There's an endless way in like a technological age for people distract themselves with silly things.,29,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_opening_JL.trs.txt,"If it's not going to be reality TV it's going to be something else, so do not ban reality TV.",30,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,We should decrease government regulation because government regulation is bad for business and of course since it's bad for business it's also bad for the people and the economy.,1,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why government regulation is bad for business and of course there is a myriad of ways in which government regulation is bad for business.,2,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So the the first of which is that there is direct harms that government regulation has cost the business.,3,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So there is costs in complying with government regulations whether it's hiring people who are constantly abreast of and informed of the myriad of government regulations that you have to be following, whether it's like paying for legal departments in compliance offices, paying for like legal staff in the event that you break a compli- some kind of regulation and you now you need to deal with it.",4,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So there's like all kinds of like direct ways in which government regulations just like spend more businesses money.,5,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,But beyond that there's also indirect ways in which government regulations hurt business revenues because they restrict the abilities of like businesses to make money.,6,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So whether it's things like like establishing like like maybe a price parameter, or establishing some kind of like restriction on like what materials you can put in a product, maybe like you can't use these cheaper materials you have to use the more expensive materials or like whatever the regulation is.",7,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,They generally like add additional cost of business in like in terms of an opportunity cost by like it takes away the ability to do cheaper alternatives maybe.,8,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,It like adds on even more cost to businesses.,9,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So why do we care about making things more expensive for businesses?,10,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Why is it bad that businesses are more expensive?,11,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So there's obviously a lot of reasons.,12,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So like first and foremost, when businesses have to spend more money on like random government regulations that's money that's not being invested in the growth of the business which is obviously not good.",13,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Beyond it not be invested in growth it's also not being invested in possibly employees.,14,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,It can't be invested in hiring and more jobs.,15,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,It can't be invested in increasing wages and things like that because the more financial stress you put on a and beyond that is also the final thing is that a lot of the prices are likely to get passed on to consumers.,16,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So like consumer products are gonna be more expensive because of government regulation.,17,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So all of that is bad.,18,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"When like you make it more expensive for businesses to do business, employees are worse off, employers are worse off, and consumers are worse off.",19,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So all of that's like super super bad.,20,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"But beyond that, it's not even necessary to increase government regulation.",21,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,We already have enough government regulation as it is.,22,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"We certainly don't need more, especially because, of course, the free market is self-regulating.",23,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"and the free market is self-regulating because if, like the government regulation, let's say like there's some shitty thing or shady thing that a corporation is doing that the government doesn't like, then the people can use the most important power that they have, the power of their wallet and the power of the market- to stop going to that business.",24,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"and that means that, like, that business will have to stop doing it.",25,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So like an example of this could be like maybe like people don't like high fructose corn syrup or whatever, people just prefer regular sugar.",26,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So like you don't need a government regulation to mandate against high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar.,27,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,If people prefer something they can use their like market power to like express that concern with the power of their wallet.,28,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,So like in a lot of ways government regulations their just like flat out unnecessary.,29,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,Markets are self-regulating and self-correcting.,30,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_opening_TL.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, we should not increase government regulation.",31,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,We should not bother banning child actors for three big reasons.,1,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"First, because I think that children are still people and can still make basic decisions about their lives.",2,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Second, because I think that we would have an important loss in narratives and like quality of television without child actors, and that's like meaningful.",3,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"And third, because I think that banning this is just too extreme, you can just regulate instead, and it's fine.",4,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe regulate it better, that's regulators fault or people being abusive's fault.",5,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,That's not like the system itself being broken fundamentally.,6,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about choice.",7,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like a lot of kids like acting, there's a reason why a lot of kids do it with their own free time.",8,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"And a lot of kids do it recreationally, because it's something that is like fun to do, it's fun to like put your like put yourself in another person's shoes, put on a performance and things like that.",9,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"A lot of people enjoy that, that's why people do it.",10,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"If you're exceptionally good at it, I see no reason why you shouldn't get paid for it.",11,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"If you are a young person who is exceptionally talented as an actor or an actress, I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to make money off those kinds of goods, in the same way as anyone else is able to make money off those goods.",12,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"You are providing a service to people, you maybe even enjoy doing that, you should be able to profit off that if you want to, that's all fine.",13,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But, I additionally think that it's important to note that we would be having a big loss in society as far as narratives are concerned, if you ban child actors.",14,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,What do I mean by this?,15,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Whenever you turn on almost any TV show, you're likely going to see children in them, and it's important because you want your television, you want your movies and your culture to be representative of culture.",16,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"so it would be very, very strange if you had, like, a bunch of adults playing children or a bunch of teenagers playing young children or things like that, or you didn't include children.",17,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like this is important from every perspective, like children watch TV and they oftentimes like like seeing children on TV, or older people can like relate to children as well, like maybe they're taking care of children or things like that, and the the TV show it's about like a family or something like that.",18,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like a lot of these touch our like basic humanistic narratives, and these things get lost if you're not going to have children as actors in television.",19,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But finally, there's the issue of extremeness here, and I think that a ban is very very extreme in that you can just regulate things effectively.",20,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, a lot of the regulations that we already have in place sound good, regulations to make sure that parents aren't able to steal this money, and that the children have rights and control over this money.",21,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Things like making sure children are still getting educated, things like making sure children don't have overly excessive working hours.",22,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"All these are good regulations, you just need to make sure that they're actually getting conducted.",23,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"This means having stronger federal and or state level enforcement of these things, making sure that you have compliance officers that can be present at TV like TV shooting sets or things like that.",24,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"All of these are very plausible regulations to put in place, many of them are in place, you just have to execute them better.",25,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,There's no reason why you have to ban this outright.,26,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So and like lose all of the obvious benefits that come from this.,27,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, for all those reasons, we should not ban child actors.",28,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,We should ban child actors because for two big reasons.,1,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"Reason number one, because it's there's no consent because these children can't possibly know what they're getting into and what the impact is gonna have on them and for number two, because even if it is something that they can consent into ultimately the harms that are likely to come out of this are just too extreme, so the paternalism that you would exert is justified and acceptable.",2,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,So first let's talk about consent.,3,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"I think that obviously consent is an incredibly important part of decision making in general in a liberal society, but I think that consent and willingness is particularly important when it comes to your job and your work because otherwise you're essentially just a forced laborer.",4,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"You're not actually freely engaging in work, and that's like obviously something that's very very egregious.",5,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"It's actually slavery, not something that you would accept in some kind of liberal and democratic society.",6,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,So let's talk about there why there's no consent in the specific circumstances then with regard to child actors and labor.,7,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,So the first reason is because they're just too young.,8,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,We are accept that children are incapable of consenting in a lot of ways.,9,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"You have things like statutory rape in age of consent for sex, we limit ability for kids to vote, to drive, to drink, do all kinds of decision making process while they're still developing while they're also while they're under the guardianship of their parents who are responsible for them and the like.",10,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"And I think this is very important because recognize that also child actors isn't just talking about teenagers or people who we perceive as maybe being more capable but oftentimes, child actors could literally mean infants.",11,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,It could mean people in elementary and middle school.,12,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,It's talking about people who are even less developed than you would think of when you typically think of younger people.,13,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,So I think that's a big problem.,14,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"The next problem is that there could there's no there's possibility of social or parental pressure, and I think that this is very real, and I think this is very likely to be important because there's a lot profit associated with child acting.",15,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,If you're a parent you can make a whole lot of money off of this possibly the famousness of your child.,16,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,So there's some pressure there but there also could just be more general social pressures that just tell you that this is something that you should do you even if you don't want to and because these are the people these are the adults that you look up to they're your parents.,17,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,You're probably likely to listen to them even if it's not what you want and that's not fair to kids.,18,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,So we shouldn't allow that to happen.,19,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,And the final reason that there's not really able to be any consent is because this is just unenforceable.,20,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,It's difficult to enforce legislation that could exist and I think the reason why it's difficult to enforce a law of this legislation is like first and foremost because there's a huge profit motive behind these industries if you're talking about things like the film industry acting and things like.,21,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"There's oftentimes a lot of lobbying incentives, a lot of like financial incentives, a lot of motives to maybe do things like legal settlements rather than create boxes things like that.",22,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,All kinds of things that make it so more likely than not you're not actually going to see enforcement.,23,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,So I don't think that that's very good on that front.,24,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"So next I want to talk about just like the degree of impact that this actually has on children,",25,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"because I think that in a lot of ways, the stress of working from a young age, the stress of having no timelines, to having to go in front of large audiences constantly, the the pressure of all of these things from your job, oftentimes this can result in like a lot of sadness for children",26,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"It can result in a social isolation, not growing up with a lot of friendships with people their own age",27,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,"because you're mostly around like professionals in a field or staff and things like that, and I think that this has a real adverse developmental effect on children and I think that this could be the reason why it's more likely that a lot of child actors end up with psychological problems or mental health issues",28,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,There's obviously examples of that.,29,,
DJ_1007_child-actors_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons I definitely think that we should bad child actors.,30,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,Marriage is outdated for two overarching reasons.,1,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"First, because I think that marriage is just an outdated institution that suppresses general human nature as with regards to sexuality and human pleasure in life, and secondarily, marriage is outdated because it enforces archaic social norms that ultimately just oppress gender minorities like LGBTQ people, or it oppresses women more broadly as an institution.",2,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,So those are the reasons why I think marriage is going to be bad.,3,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"But before I get into those reasons, I want to I want to clarify what this is a debate is actually about, because I don't think that this is a debate about whether long term monogamous relationships can be good or can make some people happy.",4,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"I think that that's something that is probably true, but I think that when we're talking about marriage, we're much more talking about the actual political, legal, religious institutions that enshrined such a way of life.",5,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"And this is very important, because I think that as a result of these legal legal, political and institutions and the like, what this does is it creates this as the predominant way of having to live your life.",6,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"So it means that what it does is it creates an environment of less choice, and it necessarily coerces or pressures people into living their life in a certain way.",7,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"As a result and as a result of this, this really brings me into my first argument, which is about how this lessens human pleasure as a result of sexual interactions.",8,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"And I think this is like an incredibly important thing, because like billions of people like in our world billions of people are going to fall in love, billions of people are going to have relationships, and like tons and billions of people are going to get married.",9,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"So whether or not these people are actually happy with their marriages, happy with their relationships and the like is incredibly important, and I think that that this is clearly not true.",10,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"there's a reason why divorce rates are at all time highs, there's a reason why infidelity is at an all time high and there's a reason why increasingly younger and younger people aren't even bothering to get married at all.",11,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"It's because what I think that it does is marriage suppresses basic human emotions, and that is whether and that is that you want to oftentimes not just be tied down to one person, you want to have different relationships with different people at different stages of your life.",12,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,What you may be interested in in in a partner is going to be very different when you're twenty than when you're thirty or when you're sixty or any other age.,13,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"And this is important, because you're going to value different things, you're going to value different ways that you connect to people, because you're in a different point in your life emotionally at these different stages in your life.",14,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"Sometimes you're going to value attractiveness more than security, you're going to value maybe like intellect, like there's all different ways in which people value different ways, and these things are never constant because people just change over time.",15,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"And this is very important, because the human desire for excitement, the human desire for love, all of these things aren't just things that exist when you're in your twenties, which is when you're supposed to get married in a in like contemporary societies or things like not more like historical societies.",16,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,These are things that are experienced throughout human life.,17,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think that being forced down to one partner throughout most of your adult life is definitely going to take away a valuable part of human experience and pleasure and happiness.",18,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,But I also think that this is oppressive socially.,19,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"I think that it's quite obvious that the institution of marriage, even if we're getting a little bit better about this, albeit with much resistance, is incredibly exclusionary for a lot of gender minorities, people who are gay, people and the like.",20,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,It's difficult for them to access the same political protections or legal protections that come as a result of marriage.,21,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"But I think that secondarily, marriages has inherently sexist roots.",22,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"The root of marriage is this idea of division of labor in that women should you should have marriage, that way men can be the breadwinners of the family unit, and that women should be the ones who are doing the light household work.",23,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"And that's really what the point of marriage was, and that's where its religious roots come from.",24,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"It was designed to make sure that women would not be able to access a lot of the privileges and benefits that men have, because it would set up society in a way which structurally disadvantages their ability to succeed in the workplace, to succeed in other walks of life, because it creates social expectations that they're going to do a predominance of housework and things like that.",25,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"I think that without the institution of marriage, these things become a lot less prevalent.",26,,
DJ_1064_marriageoutdated_pro.trs.txt,"So, for all those reasons, incredibly proud to propose.",27,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"Covenant marriage brings more good than harm, because it strengthens the bonds and institutions of marriage himself and it makes them a whole lot more meaningful, and second, it's also better for children, it's better for the health of the family as a whole, which I think is very important.",1,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about strengthening the institution of marriage.",2,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"Because I think it's important to recognize that we don't necessarily think that marriage is for everyone, especially in like a modern day society.",3,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"It's not everyone's not everyone wants to be tied down, not everyone should be tied down in marriage.",4,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"So I think that when you make marriage more binding, more difficult to actually get out of, it makes people more unwilling to opt into marriage in the first place.",5,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"So, that's like the first way in which you directly decrease rates of divorce and decrease disillusions of a family unit and all of the harms that can be associated with, which I'm going to talk about later.",6,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that it's fine, not everyone needs to get married, but the people who do get married should take that should take that marriage, take that on a whole lot more seriously than they do.",7,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"So, after that, why do I think that this is necessarily going to lead to a strengthening of the bonds of marriage, and why do I think that's good.",8,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"So, obviously, having divorce be a much more difficult option is going to make it a lot more difficult to you you're stuck with the person because of this.",9,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"So, that means you're necessarily going to see more of an emphasis on things like counseling, like marital counseling, you're going to see more of an emphasis on problem solving, and like a conflict resolution, as opposed to conflict.",10,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"And all of those things are good, because I think that that means that you're going to be more likely to stay with the person.",11,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,And that also means that the institution of marriage is a strong thing themselves.,12,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"I think that from an emotional standpoint, this can be very powerful, because while marriage may not be for all people, I think that for some people, marriage can be quite quite quite good.",13,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,And it's quite good because it gives you the ability to like essentially put like the ultimate faith and the ultimate trust in another person.,14,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"It's the ultimate feeling of connection and closeness with another person, which on a basic emotional level is very important.",15,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"Like pretty much like any human you ask does like want to feel connected to other people, does strive for like that kind of an intimacy, and marriage gives you that opportunity, and the stronger those marriage bonds are, the stronger that that sense of intimacy and closeness is going to feel.",16,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"You're not going to be fighting with the person, you're not gonna feel like you're going to need to keep secrets from the person, all those things, so I think that's going to make your marriage better.",17,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"But second and more importantly, I think that this strengthens the institutions associated with marriage, like the family and the health for children themselves.",18,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,And why do I think that that's very important?,19,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,Because divorce sucks for children.,20,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"Divorce can, for children can have a lot of like very bad emotional outcomes, especially if if it's a messy divorce where their parents are fighting a lot, where they're forced not to see",21,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"one parent a whole lot of the times, where it can be very stressful to have to frequently travel and move all of your stuff every other week to be with the other parent, even if they are close enough to stay with them",22,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,Like: so all of those things are bad.,23,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,it makes you feel less emotionally stable in like the household name that you're growing up in.,24,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,you're going to feel like less willing to talk to your parents.,25,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,you're going to feel like your family is a lot more damaged and it's not gonna feel like as like open of a space you're- maybe you're goona- be more likely to feel like isolated or away from it.,26,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"You know what, all of these things are possible, all of these things happen to children, and all of those things are very very bad and not things that you want to incentivize.",27,,
DJ_1082_covenant-marriage_pro.trs.txt,"So, for all those reasons, covenant marriage brings more good than harm.",28,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"Goal-line technology is the classy example of something that seems like quite a good idea on its face and superficially, but when you take a deeper look at something, it actually is quite harmful because it undermines the very basis of sports and the real reasons why people actually like sports.",1,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"So, for starters, let's actually make sure that we focus in on why sports are actually important and why sports actually matter or have value because I don't actually think that the value of sports comes from anything other than the entertainment factor they provide.",2,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"The value of sports comes from the fact that people enjoy them, that they bring a lot of joy to people, that they're fun, that they have a certain kind of story, a narrative that is surrounding.",3,,

DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,The only reason why sports matter is they provide an entertainment factor.,6,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"So, given that this is true, I think that goal-line technology is bad because goal-line technology removes a lot of the narratives from from sports from fifa, especially, that make it a lot more prominent and enjoyable for people.",7,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"So, what do I mean by this?",8,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"I mean that while obviously, goal-line technology can be accurate and goal-line technology can make it more likely that a goal call is going to be made correctly, I actually think that this isn't going to be good for sports because I think that there is a lot of inherent value to sports being, to some extent, arbitrary.",9,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,What do I mean by this?,10,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"So, first, I think that when fans perceive that they have been, like, like, essentially screwed over by a call that was made or the ref made an incorrect decision, what this essentially does is it creates a feeling of solidarity around the fan base.",11,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"The fan base is going to feel more fired up because they're going to say oh, well we would have won that game if it weren't for this stupid call.",12,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,Fans are ultimately going to be more likely to be fired up for the next game as opposed to if they just straight up lost.,13,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe fans would feel more dispirited, but I think that in a lot of ways, fans are much more likely to engage as well in the sport, because when fans feel like they've been wronged, they're much more likely to want to engage a sport.",14,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"so, in order to make sure that everyone in the world knows that they were wronged, fans are gonna be much more likely engage in the sport.",15,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"they're gonna be much more likely to want to cheer on people, to show the to like, essentially like: show everyone that they're good enough to win and that it was only dumb luck that robbed them last time.",16,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"Fans are much more likely to engage in the sport, and I think that's something that can be very good.",17,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"but additionally, I also think that there is a dramatized element, a narrative element that comes because when you have this like almost random and arbitrary element that's surrounding it, it creates a lot more of like stories in sports.",18,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"it's like: oh well, are the refs able to make this right call, are the refs going to do this, or that.",19,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"it creates like essentially another factor, another variable in sports, and that's ultimately one of the things that makes sports more entertaining.",20,,

DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"So, why do I think that this is true?",24,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"So, first and foremost, as far as the harms that were identified by the proposition team, obviously, ban violence cannot be reasonably sourced goal-line technology or the fact that referees make incorrect calls.",25,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"If anything, this is much more likely that some fans are irresponsible bad people who are prone to violence and that other 'cause most fans are certainly not violent and oftentimes, sometimes, people get too drunk at games.",26,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,This is probably more influenced by stadium alcohol policies than it is by the existence of goal-line technology.,27,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"But the final thing, that think that oftentimes refs are sufficiently good.",28,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,refs get extensive training on how to spot decisions.,29,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,refs are incredibly good at these kinds of decisions.,30,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"oftentimes calls are rather simple to make 'cause you have, like, a goal-line referee that has pretty good- and unobscured- often- lines of vision.",31,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,you oftentimes have multiple refs looking at the same thing.,32,,
DJ_1126_goal-line_con_SF_implicit.trs.txt,"these refs are professionals that have been doing this for a long time and get paid to do it, so I don't often think there's that much of a need for this.",33,,

DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"We should ban smacking because it's a form of child abuse, because parents have no right to physically abuse their kids, because it's absolutely something we can enforce and because I'm you know what it's a form of paternalism for parents' parts because it leads to worse parenting anyway, and it raises their kids in a worse way.",1,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why physically beating your child is absolutely wrong.,2,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,It's wrong for a couple of reasons: first because it harms the kid.,3,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"Because even if something like spanking may seem harmless, it's a fine line between spanking and abuse.",4,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"Especially if you do it continuously, especially if you do it particularly hard and this is oftentimes likely, because if you spank if you're spanking your child, it's probably because you're pretty pissed off at your child.",5,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"The kid did something that you don't like so you're going to physically you're gonna spank them to like pay them back, try to teach them a lesson.",6,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"So given that parents are doing this when they're not in a very good mood, when they're angry, when they wanna teach their kids a lesson, it's not necessarily incumbent on them to be in the mind set where they're going to be particularly gentle.",7,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"Especially because it's not like kids if they're being like gently touched, you're not really teaching them that much of a lesson.",8,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,So the entire point of it is that you need to cause them pain.,9,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,You need to make them cry or something like that.,10,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,And that's simply something that's not right.,11,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,It's not right because it's mean to the kid but also because who do parents think they are that they can just do that to kids?,12,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,Parents don't have ownership over their child.,13,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,They're it's it's like a slave master mentality where you can whip somebody.,14,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"It's absolutely ludicrous that you think that you have the right to hit another human being, to make them physically suffer, to make them be physically tormented, to physically do something, to physically try to harm them just because you want to teach them a lesson.",15,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,Just because you think it's going to make them act better or behave better.,16,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,It's absolutely horrible and it's absolutely not something that we should allow to be legal in a progressive society.,17,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"But besides that I also think that it's quite bad as far as the values that it's going to ingrain in societies , and in our children, for several reasons: first, because I think that it normalizes violence.",18,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"I think that when kids are exposed to spanking at a young age as a means of discipline, it implicates in them the idea that violence is a positive means to get people to do what you want them to do, and that if you physically harm somebody you're going you're going to get results from them.",19,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,And it's these kinds of stupid ideologies that make people think that things like torture actually works.,20,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,It's these kinds of ideologies that make it think that things like making people suffer is a good way to ultimately make there be more justice in the world and ultimately fix problems in the world.,21,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,And those are things that are incredibly bad.,22,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,But additionally it's foolish to actually think that these that spanking is actually going to lead to better discipline for kids in most cases.,23,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"Because when you physically spanking your kid, it's not like you're actually going to really teach them all that much.",24,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"You're likely just going to teach them the hide from you, to lie to you, to deceive you so that way they're going to avoid the problem.",25,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"That's the same thing with torture, where people lie because they want the pain to stop.",26,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"Like, kids are just going to figure out ways to do what they do but be more deceptive about it, because they're smart and because they want to do things that they're doing that parents don't like.",27,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,That's kind of how human nature works.,28,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,But the next thing that I want to talk about is that I think there's more effective alternatives.,29,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,"And those effective alternatives could be things like grounding a kid, not letting them go out and hang out with their friends.",30,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,Taking away like an electronic from them.,31,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,That's a perfectly acceptable nonviolent way to get your point across and it's equally persuasive and much more humane.,32,,
DJ_1144_ban-smacking_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should ban spanking.,33,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We should keep cosmetic surgery legal for two big reasons.,1,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"First, because I think that it's something that people have a right to do with their body and second, because it's probably going to happen anyway so it's better to have it under legal and safe circumstances.",2,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So first let's talk about rights.,3,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,I think that one of the most important things that we accept is that you have a right to do what you want with your own body because of all of the things that are uniquely expressive of your own individuality and your own personality and further of all the things that don't really actually affect anyone else it's what you do with your body.,4,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,That's why it's fine if you get like tattoos or piercings or things like that it's fine.,5,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"You get to pick what you wear, how your hair should look, all of these things and I don't think that cosmetic surgery is meaningfully distinct from that.",6,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It may cost a little bit more money.,7,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It may be be an alteration to your body but in a lot of ways like it's similar to maybe something like a tattoo.,8,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"It lasts forever, so what?",9,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"People can make decisions about how they want to look, what they want to look like, this is how people express their own in individuality.",10,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We shouldn't care people do that.,11,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But further I think that it's important to note that this is not only something that's done without harming anyone and it's not only a reasonable decision to make, but this is also even something that I think people can generally do with pretty good information, because when you're considering getting plastic surgery it's not like doctors are allowed to not tell you the possible risks of surgery.",12,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"They're usually required by law to talk to you about safety possible side effects of surgery, things like that.",13,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So these are generally informed decisions too.,14,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So that's all real important so given that it's informed and it's reasonable and there's no third party harms you should definitely just allow people to make this choice for themselves.,15,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"second area of argumentation I walk talk about is about safety issues, and this is important",16,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"because, in the same way, in that it's oftentimes pretty easy for people to get something like a tattoo or a piercing at a more dubious establishment or maybe, like they just have, like their cousin or friend do it, or something like that- I don't think that this is necessarily",17,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"so hard to believe for a lot of cosmetic surgeries,",18,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"because maybe some of them were a bit more complex than others,",19,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"but at the end of the day, there's still going to be a demand for cosmetic surgery",20,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,There's still going to be people who are going to want to look differently and this is important because then you're not necessarily going to have as informed decisions because you're not going to have the same laws regarding what doctors have to say to their patients.,21,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"You're not going to have the same safety checks to make sure things like equipment is clean, doctors are qualified.",22,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,You won't have those concerns.,23,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,You won't have those things.,24,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So this is going to mean that people are still going to get cosmetic surgery, but it's going to be less safe.",25,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,People are going to be more likely to experience awful side effects and that's only going to make any everything worse.,26,,
DJ_1161_cosmetic-surgery_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So I think for all those reasons I'm very proud to oppose.,27,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"We should legalize the growing of coca leaves, because its banning is cultural the remnants of cultural imperialism at its finest.",1,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about what we mean by legalizing coca leaves.",2,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"We're not legalizing cocaine, the manufacturing more concentrated form of cocaine that, often requires bleaching, insertion of chemicals, and making it a whole lot stronger and a whole lot more addictive and dangerous, that can stay illegal.",3,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"We're going to legalize the leaves in its natural form, in any kind of capacity.",4,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about why this is necessary and important.",5,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about the harms, and the coincidence of the harms, because chewing coca leaves is just something that you do, because it can give you like a tiny bit of energy, it can be like a pick me up.",6,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"In a lot of ways, it's no different than drinking a cup of coffee, because it gives you a little bit more energy, maybe or it could be someone like tobacco, which people often say tobacco can also be like a pick me up, and they chew tobacco leaves.",7,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"The interesting thing about these is that, all of these things only oftentimes give you a minor energy boost, these things aren't all that harmful, unless you abuse them, and there's not really all that much of a difference for abuse or health among all of them.",8,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"Here's the key distinction though: a lot of white people use tobacco, and a lot of indigenous people use different kinds of drugs.",9,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"So here's the problem, when you see a lot of similar affects for different substances, but you're going to criminalize one and not the other, it's important to look at why are we doing this.",10,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"And, I think that the reason why we're doing this is because, at the end of the day, there's simply not enough respect in the international community for the reasons the nuanced reasons why people actually use these things.",11,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,First and foremost of these reasons can be: people use it because they feel like using it.,12,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"And honestly, the debate should stop there, because that's a good enough reason.",13,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"If people feel like they want to get that like that small high, or that like small jolt of energy, from chewing a coca leaf, then you know what?",14,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,It's not really hurting anyone.,15,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"I don't really see why it's something that has to be a matter of international convention, and treaty, and law, given that it's pretty low impact when people do this.",16,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,It doesn't actually cause all that much harm.,17,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, I think that there is, quite obviously, something deeply insidious, and deeply imperialistic about this.",18,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"Namely, the reason why some of it is getting banned and not others is because, people don't respect the cultural traditions that are associated with it.",19,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"So for example, you can look at like people in like the andes have been growing coca leaves, and chewing them, and using them as part of ceremonies and rituals for millennia, ever like for a very very very long time.",20,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"And when you ban it, your ultimately banning their way of life, and your banning an ability for them to actually live in line with what their values are, and what their culture has been for generations.",21,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"And this is absolutely outrageous, because first of all, obviously you can't enforce this at all, you're not going to be able to go into every mountain village in the andes, and rip out a coca leaves, when you find it.",22,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, even if you could do that, it's grossly immoral to do so, because these people aren't hurting anyone.",23,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"They just want to live their lives, in a way that's accordance with their ancestors, and accordance with their values.",24,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"And especially, sense a lot of these indigenous groups have already lost so much, they've lost so many like their fellow people's lives, they've lost a whole lot of land, they've a whole lot of their culture has been erased, so you know what?",25,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"We should, probably a long time ago, but certainly by now, we should stop doing that, and we should let people have their cultural ceremonies, in a way in which they choose to do so, even if there involves a drug that is illegal.",26,,
DJ_1163_cocaleaf_pro.trs.txt,"So, for those reasons proud to propose.",27,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"Feminism absolutely brings more good than harm, first and foremost because feminism is absolutely vital in making sure that women are actually treated equally, and remaining gender gaps that do exist are eliminated.",1,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"Second, feminism is important because it helps empower women and it helps make women feel more included in society and more connected with society.",2,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"and third, I really don't think that feminism has a downside, except it takes power away from men that they probably shouldn't unjustly.",3,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"they like unjustly acquired in the first place from like historical, like structures and things like that.",4,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,or men are just like stupid in some cases and don't realize that these things don't even affect them all that much.,5,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about the practical ways in which feminism makes lives better for women.",6,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"Obviously, feminism isn't something that's just outdated.",7,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,Just because women have the right to vote doesn't mean that they have full rights.,8,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,Women still struggle for things like equal pay.,9,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"they struggle for things, like in america, like paid parental leave.",10,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"they struggle against like the acceptance of, like sexual and acceptance or understanding of sexual assault or sexual violence.",11,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,they struggle against their bodies being regulated with abortion regulations.,12,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,they struggle with access to like healthcare and contraception.,13,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"they suffer from like employment discrimination in the workplace, possibly on the base of their body or the like subjective evaluation of their skills being lesser.",14,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"All of these things are like very very prominent and very very damaging to women, and what feminism does is it provides a bulwark to like fight against these things.",15,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"What feminism does is like it provides like an organizational structure that you can like push for ground like you can push for like legal rights and things like that, so you can have things like the ACLU women's rights project, or planned parenthood organizations.",16,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"Feminism creates like a like a support or a unification for these kinds of organized pushes, which do lead to expansion of these rights, and that's important, it helps like you do all those things.",17,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"It also leads to women being inspired to like speak out on a lot of these things, so it's just going to be more likely to be grounds going to support all these things.",18,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"It also leads to increased awareness, and increased awareness is very important,",19,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"because having awareness of stigmas, having awareness of saxist stereotypes, like, like, the way, like- is",20,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"one of the best ways in which you can actually ensure that women aren't going to be, like arbitrarily excluded or to make sure that you actually listen to the concerns that women have on very sensitive issues like sexual violence or things like that",21,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"It can make sure that women have equal access to things like healthcare, it can ensure that broad whites rights for women are also considered.",22,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"Besides all of that, feminism is very important from an empowerment perspective, because I think that the idea that there is like like there is like an entire ideology associated with the empowerment of women is just by itself empowering.",23,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"It makes it that women are going to feel more comfortable trying to like go out and succeed in school, the workplace, or even like the basic relationships through their lives.",24,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"Because it rather than being told that like your gender is something that makes you lesser, or something that you have to be ashamed of, it creates a sense of empowerment and a sense of solidarity, and these are things that can be incredibly important with women.",25,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"It creates like a system of role models that you can look up to, it creates a system of like like values that you can aspire for.",26,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,All these things are very very good.,27,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"But finally, I think that feminism can bring more good than harm because like, even if you don't buy there's all that much good, like you need to show that there is harm in order to outweigh this, and I don't really think that feminism actually has any harms.",28,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"Like the nature of feminism is that they want to ensure equal rights for women, so unless you want their rights to be unequal, which is just like oppressive, inhumane in every conceivable way, then there's no real way to get around that.",29,,
DJ_1166_feminism_pro.trs.txt,"So that's for all those reasons, feminism brings more good than harm.",30,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"We should abolish three strikes laws because three strikes laws are horrible from a principal perspective, and they have very like catastrophic practical outcomes as well.",1,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why on a principled level three strikes laws are just flat out immoral.,2,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,And the biggest reason why they're immoral goes to the immorality of the criminal justice system itself as it exists.,3,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"The criminal justice system incentivizes, it essentially forces people who offend one time into recidivism.",4,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"And it and it does this because first, prisons do absolutely nothing for rehabilitation.",5,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,All they do is punish people and make their lives worse.,6,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"Once you get out of prison, you're locked out of most abilities to get jobs, you're not able to vote, you're not able to rely on public housing in most cases, you're not allowed to get public sector jobs in a lot of cases, you're not allowed to get publicly subsidized healthcare or welfare in a lot of cases.",7,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,So basically what you do is you get convicted of one crime and the system leaves you behind.,8,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"It makes it impossible for you to get a whole lot of work, oftentimes if you're a convicted criminal your license gets suspended, so you're not even able to drive to work or, it's it's like even if you get a job it's harder for you got to work.",9,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,The degree and the extent to which we put up roadblocks to people who get convicted is absolutely abhorrent in this country.,10,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,And that's a big deal.,11,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"Because all those roadblocks to be put up for people reintegrating back into society when they get convicted of a crime, means that there's really not a whole lot of options for them.",12,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,And that's why recidivism rates are sky high in places like america.,13,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,And that's why we're not really seeing meaningful progress and reform to our criminal justice system.,14,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,And that's not even talking about the fact how racist they are and about how three strikes laws overwhelmingly target african americans and other minorities.,15,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"So this is a huge problem, because the result of this is that three strikes laws create a way to permanently keep people in prison for minor offenses, for minor felonies.",16,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"And they overwhelmingly do it to minorities, and it overwhelmingly happens to people who never had much of a choice to not convict more to not commit more crimes, because they were put in a position by society where that's the only option for them.",17,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,But the next thing that I want to talk about is why on a practical level this is a really stupid idea too.,18,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,And the number one reason why that's true is because as a result of these policies in places like california it's led to skyrocketing overcrowding in prisons.,19,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,Overcrowding to the extent that courts have found that that overcrowding is unconstitutional because it creates a poor living conditions for the people in prisons.,20,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,And this is a horrible thing.,21,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,Because you're first of all wasting a whole ton of money on prisons.,22,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"All of the amount of money that goes into maintaining prisons, paying for prisoners and things like that, is money that you can pay for literally anything else.",23,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"You could burn the money and you would be doing more good to society, but but you could also just affirmatively spend it on something better.",24,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"But moreover, we're not really talking about people who we even need to put in prison for the most part.",25,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"Keep in mind if you commit like murder, or like like a series of armed robberies or rape or things like that, like truly horrible crimes, you're probably going to be imprisoned for decades and decades anyway, because those crimes are so severe.",26,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"When you're talking about three strikes laws, the people who commit a crime, get out of prison and can commit a crime again, you're usually talking about people involved in the drug industry.",27,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"So you're talking about people who are drug trafficking, people who may just be possessing people who may just be charged with like just simply the possession of drugs, while like but like they keep getting picked up over and over again, because they're minorities.",28,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,Or people who commit like more minor offenses.,29,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"Those are those tend to be the people who are in prison under these reasons, and that's why there's so much overcrowding.",30,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,And that's a horrible problem.,31,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,Because a lot of these crimes aren't all that bad for people anyway.,32,,
DJ_1243_three-strikes_pro.trs.txt,"They're things that we shouldn't be criminalizing in the first place, they're things that are absolutely a waste of money, and for all those reasons we should abolish three strikes laws.",33,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"Internet censorship brings more good than harm, for two big reasons L first, because internet censorship will prevent the rise of fake news, which is absolutely catastrophic for society, currently, and second, because internet censorship can end cyber bullying, and the horrible consequences that that results in, so, let's start by talking about fake news.",1,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"I think that, fake news is an incredibly important issue in this debate, for a couple of reasons: first, because fake news is becoming widely prevalent, as far as problems are concerned.",2,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"Keep been mind that there are millions upon millions of articles, or tens of thousands of articles.",3,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"they got millions and millions of clicks and views that are not factually verified in any way, that they can be posted by some random blog, then picked up by some random like news accumulator and finds its way on twitter.",4,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"and then suddenly you find, because of various algorithms on twitter and facebook that result in sensationalizing content being prioritized over accuracy of content,",5,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"The result that you get is that, you see a lot of fake news that's being widely disseminated, and widely read, and people interpret these things as facts, because there's no real mechanisms that check against these things.",6,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"And then secondarily, what this does, is it results in incredibly bad social harms, because it skews people's perceptions of reality.",7,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"It does this by either inventing problems that don't exist, so, you can look at something like immigration, like saying that immigrants are more likely to be rapists or murderers, even if the opposite is true, factually in reality, and oftentimes immigrants are law abiding citizens, and show more respect for the law than a lot of other people in society.",8,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"What it does is that you are can look at a lot of like fake news as the way it actually skews reality, or, on the flip side of that, it allows you to come up with just like false data or ignore problems that actually do exist.",9,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"so things like global warming, which are clearly a major threat to the entire world.",10,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,these problems can get ignored because you can just have someone put out a fake news article that discredits the actual science and then people start to believe that.,11,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,And I think that the problem with this that this lead to huge social impacts.,12,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,this guides social policy and I think that the goal of the state is to do what is in the best interests of the people.,13,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"and while it's, obviously, we're always going to have in a democratic society, a difference in values, a difference in preferences of what's important.",14,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,all of these value oriented debate should be based off of reasonable sets of facts and a reasonable reality.,15,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"Because, once you're operating from the same reality, the disagreements that you're going to have are going to be far more reasonable, and far less hostile, and you're at least going to agree that, what are the problems, and what are different ways that we can solve the problems.",16,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"But,when you have fake news rising, you're not really having constructive discourse at all.",17,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"You're not really going to be able to solve any problems at all, because the nature of the even existence of problems is, on its root, being disputed.",18,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"But, the second thing that I want to talk about is about cyber bullying, because since it's very easy for you to just make your attacks on other people anonymous, and ensure complete lack of accountability, it's very hard to punish people if they try to cyber bully somebody.",19,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"So, you necessarily need to have censorship as a way to block these kinds of harms, prevent these harms.",20,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that the importance of cyberbullying and trolling isn't something that should be understated, because when you first and foremost, there's a general fear that comes to these things.",21,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"oftentimes these things come in the form of threats, so threats to threats to your family and your safety, and this could force people into hiding in some circumstances, because they fear of the internet and all of their information getting publicly released on the internet.",22,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"it's called getting, or this could also result in severe mental health issues, even suicide in more severe cases.",23,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,So that's a clear problem that we need to combat.,24,,
DJ_1257_censor-the-internet_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, internet censorship brings more good than harm.",25,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,I think socialism brings more harm than good.,1,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"First on a principled level, socialism is unjust and is therefore oppressive when it is instituted, and secondarily I think that socialism doesn't really work all that well anyway, on account of a lot of practical consequences, as opposed to better systems of like economic and social organization.",2,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about principled objections to socialism.,3,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"I think that there's a couple of them: first and foremost, socialism inherently overrides property rights, which I think are very like very dearly important.",4,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,It's important to know that people get their property first and foremost usually by very legitimate means of putting their work into something.,5,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"It's like the result of like labor that goes into something, the craft that the put into something, and that labor is meaningful because like it's your effort, it's your.",6,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"it could be like- maybe it's like your ideas for some kind of book, maybe it's like your research for a patent.",7,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"all of these things are ultimately as a result of the labor that you put into it, and they wouldn't exist, and any benefits that come from them would not exist, without the effort and ingenuity that you put into it individually.",8,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,But secondarily I also think that property is in a lot of ways just like an extension of yourself and it's an extension of your identity.,9,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"So if, at any time, if, like, if you don't feel a sense of ownership, say, over your computer, or a sense of ownership over the place that you live, I think there's like a good deal of identity, a good deal of like feeling of like economic security and a good feeling of like accomplishment that are associated with a lot of the with like having possession of property",10,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,And I think that these things are incredibly important for tangible success but also important for internal feelings like success and accomplishment and those aren't things that we should underestimate.,11,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"I additionally think that like as an additional principled objection, I think that socialism is bad because it necessarily results in imposed values on other people.",12,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,So what do I mean by this?,13,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,Socialist societies tend to take other people's money and use it for other thing.,14,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"Like you take someone's money and you use it to like have like more like big healthcare system or some other kind of like socialized system, like food or whatever, whatever kind of socialized system that exists.",15,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,Here's the problem: what this does is overrides individual preferences that people may have on how they actually wanna spend their money and this is very important because different people are going to want to spend their money in different ways.,16,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,Different people may not care as much about the longevity of their life compared to like the quality of their life.,17,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"They may be more willing to not spend as much money on healthcare, which they would be forced to in a socialist system on their taxes, they may prefer to spend that money on a nicer car if that makes them happy.",18,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"They may be better off spending that money on investing in their children's education, they may be better off investing that money and just like a nice vacation that they've always wanted to take.",19,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,There's no correct way to live a life and socialism attempts to override this by saying that there is one way in which we have to live a life and that this is the way in which these things have to work.,20,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that's like an inherent degradation of the like individuality of human life, which is bad.",21,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"So, all those principled objections are enough for socialism to be bad but socialism is also bad because it doesn't work.",22,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think that like capitalism generally results in one, more money accumulated by more people, and secondarily it results in like more innovation.",23,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"So these things are good because when more people are making more money, they're able to like improve their qualities of their lives, but also a innovation focused drive also means that like quality of life goes up.",24,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,So like what are like concrete ways which these things look like?,25,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"So, things like like the green like thing you can look at something like a green revolution in farming because of like like, big corporations getting involved in these things like that and they can lead to like genetically modified foods that save billions of lives possibly, by preventing starvation.",26,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,You can see that things like like factories in a lot of parts of the world do increase like the wealth in those areas.,27,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"It's not a perfect system, you probably want more regulation, but it was certainly better than before where there was almost no money and no opportunities for economic growth or infrastructure investment in areas.",28,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,All of these things do help and this is why global poverty has been plummeting and capitalism does work.,29,,
DJ_1261_socialism_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons socialism does more harm than good,30,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not ban human cloning because human cloning is an absolutely fantastic way to help a lot of people, and also there's no real reason why human cloning is all that bad or even remotely unethical, contrary to what other people may argue.",1,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why human cloning is just good for people.,2,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"First and foremost, there's really obvious health benefits to it.",3,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"A lot of a lot of the biggest difficulties that we have in certain kinds of like lifesaving treatments, are that a they're a lot of them don't exist and things are unrepairable.",4,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So like if you get nerve damage and you end up handicapped from like the waist down, you're probably never going to be able to walk again and that's gonna be a problem.",5,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Or if you get like permanent heart damage, you can't really just like replace someone's heart very easily in a lot of contexts.",6,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"If you get brain damage, that's another thing that can cause you problems.",7,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,There's a lot of permanent problems that you can experience.,8,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Cloning offers a unique solution to a lot of these problems in a couple of ways: first and foremost you know with absolute certainty that there's going to be a compatibility with the other person.,9,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"One of the biggest problems that we see now, whether it's like one of the biggest problems we see now , even in like more minor treatments like simply like blood transfusions and things like that, there is always a very big need to check to make sure that there's compatibility.",10,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And when you're especially doing like when you're doing like , when you're talking about new organs and things like that, compatibility is a very big issue that you have to take care of.",11,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"But when it's literally like like a clone of the organ that already existed, it's like there's going to be like a great deal of certainty that the treatment is gonna be more successful and you're gonna able successfully transition.",12,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So, this is like a huge huge thing.",13,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Because you can literally like help people who are like handicapped, who have brain damage, there's all like there is endless applications to this in the medical world.",14,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So obviously cloning is very good in that regard.,15,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"I also think cloning is very good for helping people who could be infertile for one reason or another, or but people who still want to have kids.",16,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And people who want to have a kid that maybe like them.,17,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And that's obviously something that if they want to do they should have the right to do and they should be able to pay for a clone or something like that.,18,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Having a kid is like a pretty important part of a lot of people's lives, it's something that people get a lot of like like pleasure and satisfaction out of, it gives a lot of people meaning your like raising a young person in the same way that you were raised, like there's a reason why a lot of people like to have families.",19,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,It gives them like a lot of like close connections and things like that.,20,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Equally the same, some people are infertile, some people can't have kids for one reason or another.",21,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Now cloning could be an answer to that and natural cloning could be a way in which people can experience the joys of like raising a child, of having like family and things like that.",22,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And they can do that in a way that wasn't previously available to them before.,23,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"You can make your lives meaningfully better, meaningfully happier, and that's something that I think is pretty important and we should consider.",24,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,The final thing that I want to talk about though is why I think that a lot of the like unethical jibber jabber against cloning is kind of just stupid.,25,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,For a few reasons: first and foremost I don't really know what exactly they think is like the unique benefit of like a baby has to come out of a woman's vagina verses a baby has a baby can come out of like a test tube or a laboratory or things like that.,26,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Because when you think about it it doesn't really matter where the baby comes from because at the end of the day it's not like the baby that was cloned is any less human than the than the person that he was originally cloned from.,27,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"It has the same blood, it has the same brain, it has the same skin, it it has the same like emotions and feelings and consciousness, there's no reason why we shouldn't look at cloned humans as anything other than just human beings.",28,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And just because they came into existence in a different way doesn't mean that we should think any lesser of them, think that they're unethical or other nonsense like that.",29,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, do not ban cloning.",30,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"We should ban human cloning because it's not safe and that's really big problem when you're talking about human lives and it's also a threat to humanity in a broader sense, in a macro sense.",1,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why cloning is so unsafe.,2,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,And the thing about dolly the sheep that was in.,3,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,that's interesting- besides the fact that it dolly exists in the first place- is that dolly died after a couple of months of like some kind of disease.,4,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,like dolly didn't last very long and a lot of cloned animals do not last very long.,5,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"and the reason is that because, despite the progress that's being made in testing to some extent, it's still very imperfect.",6,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"when you're talking about cloning another human, another, another species in its totality,",7,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,And if we can't really do it with a lot of animals in perfect way then we definitely shouldn't be risking with humans because unlike when you're cloning an an animal like if you clone a lamb and the lamb maybe fifty percent of the sheep live and fifty percent of them die and that's okay when you're talking about sheep.,8,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"But when you're talking about human beings, these things have huge consequences, and if you bring a being into this world and it dies a couple of like years later, or a couple of months later, even of some kind of weird cancer or some kind of strange disease, then you've basically caused suffering to a living sentient being, and that's obviously something that's like really really a big problem",9,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,Not something that you can underemphasize in the same way in which like we wouldn't deem it moral to like essentially like inject some kind of disease into a regularly birthed child that makes him more likely to have problems it's really not fair to do it in cloning because you're basically just doing a procedure to create a child that is more likely to be dangerous.,10,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,So that's like a big problem.,11,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,But the next thing is that it's also a threat to humanity in a broader sense in a couple of ways.,12,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"So while it's tricky to look at this in the short term because things like evolution happen over a macro sense, a lot of ways this undermines the basis of life in that the reason why human beings exist is because of evolution.",13,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"Human beings exist because they evolved a lot of good traits, like opposable thumbs, like having good brains, things like that that like are things that you evolve over time.",14,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,They don't happen at once.,15,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,And cloning essentially eliminates the ability to actually have evolution because when you're just cloning something you're creating something that's absolutely identical.,16,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,That's like that's why like with asexual reproduction you don't really get like a whole lot of a difference there cause you're creating exact identical copies.,17,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"But when you're talking about like natural mating, the crossing of two different species, you create more of an opportunity for evolution to happen, for mutations to happen, because you're not allowing a simple clone to exist.",18,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"But beyond that, I also think that this has impacts for the importance of genetic diversity cause, especially when there's like a risk of like like.",19,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"we see this with crop failures, where when every crop is of the exact same species and some kind of disease comes in, all of the crop dies because there's no genetic diversity, and that's like one of the big reasons why genetic diversity is important.",20,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,It makes a species as a whole strong.,21,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,So like in a time where there is like risk of like bioengineered like bio weapons maybe or like accidental release of like a mutated diseases or things like that having like genetic diversity in a human population is like a pretty important thing.,22,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,But the final thing is that it's not really necessary to have human cloning in this sense because alternatives are sufficient.,23,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"Therapeutic cloning is fine if you want to clone a lung, if you want to clone a liver, something then that's fine you can do that, that's different.",24,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,"And also you can just have organ donors, you can have in vitro fertilization, there's like there's a lot of alternatives to reproduction besides cloning that people can use if they can't reproduce naturally.",25,,
DJ_1264_human-cloning_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should keep banning cloning.,26,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not adopt libertarianism because I think on both a principle and on a practical level of how the world works, libertarianism is a rather flawed ideology.",1,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what actually defines libertarianism and I think that what defines libertarianism most is it's extremism in a way in which it values concepts like ownership.,2,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So when you think about it, the property that you own whether it's the computer that I'm using for these recordings to your house or your car, or anything like that, obviously to some extent these are the results of your labors.",3,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It was your money or something like that.,4,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But I think that the state, also to some extent, has some kind of ownership over it and society to some extent has done things like that.",5,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Society does things like create roads, you're able to make money, it creates like an economic regulation, it creates courts, it does all kinds of things to make sure that your life is functional in such a way in which it's possible for you to even have property in the first place.",6,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So what libertarians propose to do is have those services but have them valued at the lowest way possible and, whenever possible, always deferred to individual property rights.",7,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"but I think this is a problematic conception of the way to actually look at the world in a principled level, because you shouldn't look at property as just some persons, as an individual bit of property owned by a person.",8,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"rather, you should look at it as a whole.",9,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"lot of collective factors went into making that property possible, so therefore the state has some degree of right and ownership over it, and I think that that's very important because that changes the evaluation from if we're trying to say, tax somebody higher, is this a matter of a rights violation?",10,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,verses helping people not starve?,11,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Or is this a or is this?,12,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,instead of debate of you know what?,13,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"the state has a right to this, any some this anyway?",14,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"now we should have more of a discussion about what degree this is going to be taken to, and I think that the impact this has is that it's going to lead to the state being more willing to take and more willing to actually spend things on public goods, which is, I think, important",15,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"because, by and large, libertarian ideology manifests itself in a way in which you're going to have less services, which means that people are going to be more vulnerable to things like corruption, more vulnerable to things like circumstances out of their control",16,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"All of these things when the state is minimizing its social safety net, it's minimizing its infrastructure, all of that's going to be worse off which I think is bad.",17,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But I also think on a practical level libertarianism is rather ridiculous in its purported outcomes.,18,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So first, on, like a principal level, the idea of libertarianism is that we're most free if there is minimal state intervention and we have ownership over our own property.",19,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"but I think the problem is that when you have minimal state intervention in things, you don't actually even achieve the outcome of people being most free.",20,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"and I think the reason for this is because without government regulation of the economy, without government regulation to like help people up if they're in a, if they're in a disadvantaged circumstance, then you're not actually free to essentially live your life in the way in which you see fit.",21,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,You're not actually free to maximize on individual choices and things like that which are undermining ideological goods of libertarianism.,22,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"I think that, as far as facilitating even the end goals of libertarianism in a lot of ways, state regulation is required to make sure that people are treated fairly in a whole lot of ways, and I think that libertarianism doesn't really focus",23,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"so much on those ends as much as it focuses on the means, as much as it focuses on the right to not have state intervention, a right to own your property, as those inherent goods being more valuable than the end goal",24,,
DJ_1542_libertarian_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"I think that by and large critiques of libertarianism focus on the best ways to meet those end goals and I think that for all of those reasons, libertarianism should not be adopted.",25,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,The internet definitely brings more good than harm for a few big reasons.,1,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"first, because the internet is an absolute miracle in the way in which it allows expanded access to information and expanded ways in which you can communicate with each other and how quickly you can communicate with each other in easily.",2,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but in addition to those being fundamentally good, the internet is also incredibly good from a financial perspective.",3,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"It makes just about everything cheaper, and easier, to do in your lives, and it creates an entire sector of an economy in advanced technologies.",4,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about these things.",5,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"First, let's talk about information.",6,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"I think that, it's obvious that the internet brings incredible opportunities for information.",7,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"First and foremost, the ease of access of that information, rather than having to possibly go to various distant locations, trying to track down text, in order to find what you're looking for.",8,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"The internet allows you to have a centralized data base, that you can use to try to access information.",9,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, whether it's whether you're trying to like research, a policy or learn about historical event or a movement or anything of the sort, it's going to be that much easier because you're now going to have almost infinite information you can find, like academic research about things, journalistic articles about things, what people are saying, blogs.",10,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,those are all different ways in which you can find out information.,11,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, I think that that makes you a lot smarter, and it makes you a lot more educated, because it's a lot easier to access answers.",12,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And, that's also good from a socio economic perspective, because rather than having to pay for a lot of these resources, paying for a lot of these books, and things like that, a lot of these things are free, and it allows information be more easily accessed by a lot more people in society.",13,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But, there is additionally the benefits of communication.",14,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,You're able to keep in touch with people better that may live somewhere far away.,15,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,you're better able to communicate your ideas with people.,16,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"you're better able to organize, like social movements and political movements, because you're better able to communicate ideas across like large groups of people.",17,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"it lets you more easily interact with people from far away places and other cultures, because the internet makes the illusions of it, makes distance much more of an illusion.",18,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"I think it also just let's communication happen a whole lot more quickly, which is great in terms of being able to just like get your points across quickly, actually keeping like a better sense of closeness and contact with people.",19,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But, finally I think that, a lot of these things also have an incredibly good impact on businesses.",20,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, being more able to access information, or being able to better like spread your ideas, maybe in academic community, those are just like examples of ways, in which the internet can help economies grow, because the spread of ideas, and the spread of information greater access of all these things, are some of the bigger driving forces in the economy.",21,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But additionally, the internet also creates its own business, because it creates an entire sector of an economy that, people work in.",22,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So you have like programmers, you have people who like sell computer products, develop hardware, develop software, marketing, like there's all kinds of things that people do for the internet, innovators.",23,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And, this is incredibly important, because the internet revolves around a way of innovating new products to improve people's lives, there's a whole lot of like jobs in there, w whole lot of economic benefits, and profits that are being made from the internet.",24,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, a lot of these things also result in just cheaper goods overall, things that make people's lives easier, or cheaper, and those are all incredibly important things to recognize, incredibly important benefits.",25,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But, finally, I don't really think that the harms of the internet are all that unique to the internet.",26,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"A lot of these things can be checked, by maybe like regulating like the quality of content online, if you're worried about like fake news or something like that, or cyber bullying, or trolling, or things like that.",27,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"A lot of the harms of the internet can be checked, as long as you properly regulate it and responsibly make sure that , things aren't going poorly.",28,,
DJ_1681_internet_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, for all of those reasons, I definitely think that the internet does more good than harm.",29,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,International recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia are definitely justified.,1,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"So, the first thing that we should consider is: why do these people want independence anyway?",2,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,Why would anyone want independence?,3,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"Cause it's important to note that independence isn't just some easy thing that you ask for, or you push a like you like check a box on a ballot initiative and suddenly you get it.",4,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"Independence takes up a ton of political will, it can cost a whole lot of money, there can be huge transition costs associated with the establishment of the new government, there's also a whole lot of instability that's associated with getting independence.",5,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,It's not this easy thing to do.,6,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"So, given that independence is difficult and it does come with risk, the fact that people want independence so badly is pretty telling.",7,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"So, what do I think it's telling about this, and where do I think therefore are like the real reasons why this international recognition is justified?",8,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"First, the international recognition is justified because it allows these people to have their own destiny and their own way of choosing how to like spend their money, live their lives, and all of this, which I think is just a right that people should have, and second, I think that it ensurers a freedom from like oppression of the, of people.",9,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"Independence prevents as much of an ability for some kind of exterior imperialistic force or whatever to have exert their control over you and your resources, which I think is quite bad.",10,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about like the concept of freedom of control over your own like policy priorities and things like that.",11,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"Because recognize that if you're not independent, and especially if you are not independent and like your, like cultural group is not the majority, then decisions about when to go to war, decisions about how much to spend on education or healthcare, who's going to get more money spent on education or healthcare or investing and things like that?",12,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"who's going to like, invest in, like, where infrastructure projects or government grants, whether these employment opportunities going to come forth.",13,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,All of these things are going to be first and foremost done in a way in which you're not actually going to have the power over these things.,14,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,So they're inherently less democratic.,15,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"You're not, if you were independent you'd just get to have control over all the spending priorities and things like that, so these are in line with your own values and your own preferences which are first and foremost like more likely to be accurate the more local they are, but secondarily can be like widely different values based on different cultures.",16,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,So you can't just assume because you live near someone that this is like a fair way of actually going near these kinds of things.,17,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"But in addition to this just being like more democratic and like more representative, this is also better in the way in which it's distributed because keep in mind that like if you have like power over a group and your the group in power, you're going to want to distribute your resources in a way that's going to be better suiting for you.",18,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"You're more likely going to see, if you live in a different, if like the like primary control is in one region, you are more likely to see like the investment focusing on that region and you're going to be less likely to therefore see like the fair consideration.",19,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,So I think that's bad.,20,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"But, additionally I also think that like it's important to note why people are so resistant to independence.",21,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,And they're resistant because they're just like greedy.,22,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,They're just resistant because they wanna take advantage of natural resources in these places.,23,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,They want to take advantage of like like keeping these people down economically so they can take advantage of that cheaper labor.,24,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,They want to take advantage of them so like they can like keep discriminating or things like that.,25,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"These are grossly illegitimate reasons why you wanna maintain, or like you wanna maintain like your own like international perception of superiority or like you wanna maintain an image of soft power around the world.",26,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,"Those things are not more important than the actual livelihoods of these people, who are being oppressed, the livelihoods of people who aren't actually getting able to decide their own ways of living their lives, and do so democratically.",27,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,I think that this is just like the definition of oppression and these are things that the international community should not condone.,28,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,And the only reason they wouldn't do so is out of fear or selfishness.,29,,
DJ_1964_south-ossetia_pro.trs.txt,So very proud to propose.,30,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,We absolutely should not criminalize suicide.,1,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,I think that's a hole absolutely horrible thing to do for the people who are involved and are in a really bad place.,2,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,When you think about it would you criminalize cancer?,3,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Would you criminalize a heart attack?,4,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Would you criminalize any other kind of physical disease?,5,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,I think that the obvious answer to that is no.,6,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Of course you wouldn't do that.,7,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,What kind of messed up person would punish somebody for having cancer in some kind of criminal fashion?,8,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that that's where this real problem comes in.,9,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Because suicide isn't just some kind of like inherent defect or some kind of like like choice that people make with the intent to harm others with the intent to like trying to like recoup money or something or with the choice of like fucking over god.,10,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,This isn't a choice that people make when they're in a healthy state of mind.,11,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,It's a choice that people make because they're depressed because they have bipolar disorder because they have real mental illnesses that are not being treated well enough or that are so severe that people simply do not have the support necessary to overcome those kinds of things.,12,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that that's already inherently an immoral thing to do and the debate should stop there.,13,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,You should not criminalize disease you should be sympathetic to people who have diseases and you should offer support to people who have a disease.,14,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,And you should try to help them.,15,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,You shouldn't punish them for the way in which they feel or for something that is out of their control and that's an absolutely horrible thing to do.,16,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,But besides that I also think you're certainly not going to make the problems of suicide any less present just by criminalizing it.,17,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"Because when you actually go into the complexities of people who have mental health problems, the complexities of people that have depression, when people feel the way that they feel they don't really feel comfortable coming out with that, they don't feel comfortable going to a therapist or reaching out to people for support and they don't feel comfortable doing that",18,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"because they oftentimes feel that something is wrong with them,",19,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,because that's the way the depression works,20,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"that's the way that people like when you're suicidal, you're probably not just going around blurting out: I'm suicidal, come and help me.",21,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,These people are oftentimes struggling in silence and they do that because we live in a society in which people don't understand mental health in which people think that it's okay to criminalize it because they think that it's a choice that people make to hurt others or hurt god or some other kind of thing like that.,22,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,And when people misunderstand mental health in that kind of a way it only makes people who have mental health problems feel even worse about themselves and are even less likely to come forward.,23,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"And it also, from a policy perspective, effects the way in which we're willing to put money aside and it effects the way in which the public is willing to spend money on public health resources.",24,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"and it's a big reason why, when you look at it like, prisons are the number one provider of mental health resources in america, because that's where like, like, where most of these kinds of things end up happening, because we just simply do not offer, like merely adequate enough support for people who have mental health issues.",25,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So that's obviously like another big reason why criminalization simply isn't the answer to this.,26,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"I think at the end of the day, this is like a very clear issue: are you going to try to be sympathetic and understanding and actually come up with proactive and constructive solutions to help them with mental illness issues and depression, or are you simply just going to assume the worst in people?",27,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,are you going to assume that people are making a choice and are you going to assume that you can punish people out of taking their own life?,28,,
DJ_1982_suicide_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,of course you should choose to be empathetic and understanding and for those reasons you shouldn't criminalized suicide.,29,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Banning the sale of violent video games to minors is an absolutely ridiculous idea.,1,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And it's ridiculous because if you wanna actually end violence with things like guns, then you should ban guns, not video games.",2,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,That's how you actually solve the problem.,3,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So I wanna start by talking about this absolutely nonsensical causality between between violence in video games and violence in real life.,4,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So the first thing to note is that it just doesn't make any sense.,5,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"If you ask just about like any twenty year old, like almost all guys in their twenties or early thirties, or a lot of kids today, almost all of them played games like call of duty or grand theft, auto or similar games that involve some degree of violence and shooting, and you don't see millions and millions of people who played these games ultimately becoming violent in the streets, thinking things like beating up a hooker on the street is something that's acceptable to do in real society",6,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,It's because people are a lot smarter than you give them credit for and they're able to make a separation between the fantasy that they see in a video game and the reality that they see when they're actually driving a car down the street.,7,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"The idea that sometimes people emulate crimes of video games are obviously, first and foremost, like based on isolated instances that can't really be separated from anything else.",8,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,You can see violence in a movie and people may try to re-enact it.,9,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"You can see violence in other kinds of walks of life, and oftentimes either just a facade that society uses to blame the actual real to deflect from the real an underlying problems.",10,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And these are namely, first and foremost, that people often have sometimes people have poor mental health, and we don't have the adequate services in place to help people with poor mental health, and we don't have a lot of support in place often times, and we much rather blame them that help them.",11,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And secondarily we have things like widespread access to guns and the like, that make crime a lot more accessible and easy to do.",12,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,But the next thing I want to talk about in that minors should have the right to play the video games that they wanna play video games.,13,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, especially if they have the money to buy them on their cells, but if their parents wanna but if their parents don't mind then like this is absolutely certainly ridiculous, and that people should be able to decide the way in which they have fun and enjoy things.",14,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"You wouldn't tell a minor that they have to play basketball but they can't play football, because they're maybe more balance associate, or you have to play tennis but you can't play basketball, or you can't watch tv shows that how more violence in them.",15,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Like these these kinds of things are absolutely ridiculous because people should be allowed walk but they're interested in, especially in a modern day where you can get all kinds of information on the internet, where it's literally impossible to effectively regulate the lives of minors in the way that people falsely think is necessary.",16,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,People can live their lives the way they wanna live even if they're younger.,17,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"They're mature enough to be able to play a violent video game, enjoy it if they want to do, and not of any problems with that.",18,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,But the final thing that I wanna talk about is that this is absolutely unenforceable.,19,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And this is unenforceable for a few reasons: first and foremost, because most parents just won't care at all.",20,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So if the idea is that you wanna end the causal link between violence in real life and violence in video games, most parents just don't care about their kids playing violent video games.",21,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, I certainly know I wouldn't.",22,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"My parents didn't care, the millions of millions of kids who play call of call of duty or grand theft auto, their parents didn't care either.",23,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And I don't know why they would start to care suddenly now that there's some amorphous ban in place.,24,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"But also, kids are still gonna want these games.",25,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Kids will ask their older brothers and sisters to get them for them, older friends, they can get them on internets, where ID checks are maybe not as common or things like that, they can lie about their age, there's all kinds of ways in which you can get these things in other avenues.",26,,
DJ_1_ban-video-games_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So for those reasons it's ridiculous to ban violent video the sale of violent video games to minors.,27,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not further exploit nuclear power and we shouldn't exploit it further,1,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because, while nuclear power is arguably in at some cases, better than some of our current energy uses, like fossil fuels, I don't think that it's better than green energy as far as the comparative is concerned, and I think that further exploitation, especially if it's going to happen right now, should be largely focused on green energy, and there's necessarily a trade off in terms of resources for investment",2,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,If you were to invest in nuclear power that will come at the expense of green energy.,3,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's talk about those two things.,4,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"First, why green energy is better than nuclear power and secondarily, why there's going to be a trade off between the two that's bad.",5,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So first, why is green energy better?",6,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that first and foremost it's safer.,7,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Green energy they first and most obviously can't be weaponized.,8,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,You're not going to be able to weaponize the wind or solar energy.,9,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So whenever states try to come up with excuses like oh well we need to have this nuclear factory for peaceful purposes or whatever, well now that's not an excuse anymore because you don't really need nuclear power because green energy could be a thing.",10,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But additional it is also risks of meltdowns and while meltdowns aren't all that common in the status quo and not they don't happen all that often, there's two problems.",11,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"First, when they do happen they're quite severe.",12,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So if you think that, for example, like things like like- I think it's like six mile island or whatever in america, or chernobyl in like russia or ukraine, you look at the fukushima disaster in japan, these things have made entire areas essentially unlivable and because of global radiation spread through things like the wind.",13,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"whenever there's like nuclear fallout from a meltdown, these things have big consequences.",14,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but additionally, also when you're upping the scale of production, that's also going to add in more risk.",15,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Especially now when you have a lot more environmental volatility, in a global warming era, when there's a lot more natural asters.",16,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but I think that, additionally, it's also going to be, in the long term, better from a an environmental perspective, in a cost perspective, because there's always going to be some kind of green energy alternative, like there's probably very few places on earth that don't either have running water that you can use for hydroelectric power, wind that you can use for wind energy or sunlight.",17,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"If a place doesn't have water, doesn't have wind, doesn't have like a lot of sunlight, it's very difficult to find a place on earth that meets all of these criteria.",18,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"so, or example, maybe massachusetts isn't that sunny, but it's very windy.",19,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"maybe somewhere like texas or israel is a lot more sunny, even if it doesn't have as much, say, like running water or things like that.",20,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So there is those arguments but I also think that as far as cost is concerned uranium is you have to set up the factory, you have to put in a whole lot of cautions on the factories for like nuclear factories, you have to mine uranium.",21,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Uranium is a whole lot rare and more expensive.,22,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So all of these things are also on the cost terms if you're going to exploit something or invest in something more on the cost terms it's probably going to be better to and cheaper and more versatile in the long run to use green energy.,23,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And this is a problem because, in terms of absolute, absolute terms, there's going to be limited resources as far as what you invest in, so the government just isn't going to be able to invest in everything that you want to.",24,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but also, on, like, the political level, there's always going to be political checks that you are going to make, so that the government's never going to be able to spend all the money on things.",25,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So if you're further exploiting nuclear power as your energy source once you see your energy needs are satiated you're probably not going to be is likely to want to invest even more money into other things like green energy when they're not seen as necessary because you already have nuclear power.,26,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So I think that for all those reasons, we should not further exploit nuclear power.",27,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"We should absolutely further exploit nuclear power because it is cheaper and more more efficient than a lot of alternatives, and because it's also better for the environment and cleaner than a lot of the alternatives.",1,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why it's cheaper more effective.,2,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"The sad reality is that while things like solar energy wind energy in hydroelectric energy are great non renewable resources, they're also by and large not very efficient and very expensive compared to our actual need.",3,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"And that's a problem because while those are viable long term strategies, the reality is that things like climate change and pollution and all that are big problems, and they're big problems right now, that we need to solve right now.",4,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,And they aren't just things that we can wait a decade or so until technology develops and investments develop in green technology and things like that.,5,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"So, as long as that's the case we need to look at alternatives and I think that nuclear energy is an incredibly viable alternative a great alternative in fact.",6,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,A lot of countries like france predominately get their energy from nuclear power.,7,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"It's mostly places like america which is one of the biggest the biggest polluter in all of history, that is reliant on sources of energy like coal and gas and things like that.",8,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"So why are these forms of , so obviously coal and gas are bad in that like their big polluters things like that.",9,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,The big appeal for them is that they're cheap compared to green technologies.,10,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"However, nuclear energy is incredibly efficient in the way that it's used and it's oftentimes a whole lot cheaper, because you don't really need all that much uranium.",11,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,It's not like weapons grade uranium.,12,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,Like you don't really need to enrich it to pass certain levels and things like that all that much.,13,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,You don't need to get as much like advanced technologies and things like that.,14,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"In a lot of ways we've been using nuclear power for a long time, it's pretty like well developed, works pretty well, it's efficient, checks up all the boxes for a workable source of of our energy.",15,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,And this important because they also think that it's clean and good for the environment.,16,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"So there's some people who are like: "" wow, wait.",17,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,But what about the possibility of a nuclear meltdown and radioactive waste and things like that?,18,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"That sounds pretty bad for the environment. """,19,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"So, true, those things may not be great but first and foremost those things are pretty rare.",20,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"There's only a handful of cases where you actually see nuclear power plants going to melt down, and these are usually the results of like very rare natural disasters.",21,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,So things like a tsunami in case of fukushima or things like that.,22,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"But oftentimes it's not the result of like the technology itself being bad, it's a result of natural disasters, which is a problem because you can just as easily see these accidents are just as common with things like oil and natural gas.",23,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"You see explosions with this kinds of things all the time, you can see like oil spills literally happen all the time.",24,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"There so much oil in the oceans, it's ridiculous and it's obviously horrible for wildlife and these things are oftentimes more widespread.",25,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"It's maybe just not as like eye popping as nuclear meltdowns in most cases, so I think that's a big thing there.",26,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,But it's also important because the next thing is also on the issue waste and things like that.,27,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"So nuclear waste is like probably a whole lot better than pollution and things like that, in standard things like coal and coal mining or injecting chemicals into the ground for something like fracking for oil or any of these kinds of things.",28,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"The bigger reason for that is like it's a pretty big world and it's pretty easy to secure nuclear waste in like individual facilities and places like that, in incredibly secure locations.",29,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"So like you can like store it like deep underground or like in mountains and things like that, where there's almost no risk of it actually going anywhere.",30,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"And like sure it's going to build up forever, it's essentially a nuclear landfill which isn't great, but ultimately these things are a whole lot better than the status quo, which is most of these things instead pollution just gets pumped into the air that we breathe, which is bad.",31,,
DJ_2081_nuclear-power_pro.trs.txt,"So yes, further exploit nuclear power.",32,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,Nationalism is the ultimate disease of our modern times and it is certainly something that does more harm than good.,1,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"Think that there are two big reasons why nationalism is just absolutely awful for societies: first, it's bad because of the way in which it it create it otherizes the outside.",2,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"It creates it incentivize a slew of like racist policies, retroactive policies that harm people outside of the nationalistic group.",3,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And secondarily I think that it's bad because of the ultimate injustices that it does to people inside the group as well.,4,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,The way in which it hurts its own people.,5,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about exterior influences of nationalism.",6,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,I think that nationalism has really bad exterior influences on people because of the way in which it persuades people to think about others.,7,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"It persuades people to think about others in a negative light , like, these people of like another race trying to hurt us, it fosters a sense of light out fighting against them, it ultimately incentivize the people to be more willing to encourage and back like aggressive military action or annexation or even war, things like that.",8,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,It also incentivizes people to be very very anti immigration very inherently suspect of people who don't fit the stereotypical image of someone in that group.,9,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"So, when you look at a place like america you see a lot of like great fears of people who are like muslim or people who are hispanic, or even like african american, because it doesn't fit the idea of like the white patriot from like revolutionary times and like fit into that narrative.",10,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,I think that there is like all kinds of problematic ways in which nationalism manifests itself in that regard.,11,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And this creates like ultimately like just bad policies and it makes it so that we treat people worse outside of those groups.,12,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,The next thing that I wanna talk about is the way in which nationalism hurts people internally.,13,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,This is also really important because nationalism can be used as a weapon to silence dissent.,14,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,", because if you are able to like paint someone who doesn't wanna support what you're doing as the government, as, you can paint them is anti american or something like that, it becomes a lot easier to just discard their arguments.",15,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"So, you can suddenly have a debate about like like socialized medicine or something like that isn't american.",16,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"You're not having a discussion about the merits of it, you're not having a discussion about whether or not good or bad, you're having a discussion about like these arbitrary values and that's a way in which it discourages the actual quality discourse of like quality discussions and ideas being brought forward.",17,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"The next, the final thing I wanna talk about though is that it also tries to persuade alter the perceptions of for people about what is important.",18,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"When when you live in like a more nationalistic society you're more likely, as I mentioned earlier, to focus on things like wars, focusing on things like national security and the like.",19,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,But all of these things come at an expense of solving interior problems.,20,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,So every dollar that gets spent on things like the military is money that can't be spent on infrastructure.,21,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,It's money that can be spent on education or health care for people.,22,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And I think that when you're thinking about what are the more important things I think that does the the things I was talking about are certainly more important than the the more important things.,23,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,The things that affect more people's lives in a positive way.,24,,
DJ_2101_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And that is the final reason why nationalism does more harm than good.,25,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"The bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were absolutely not justified, and I think that the biggest reason for that is because of the mass scale of civilian casualties it resulted in.",1,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that this is simply something that could never be justified, but this is specifically something that cannot be justified given that this can happen in tandem with other more preferable options, in my opinion.",2,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about civilian casualty and civilian death.",3,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"I think that it's very clear that civilian casualties in a war are bad, something that you want to avoid.",4,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,But I think that the key reason why they have a great deal of moral weight to it is because of the idea of culpability.,5,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, look at it this way.",6,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"If you as the listener, like as you as the listener, if I'm like angry about something because maybe your friend did something, so I shoot you in the head, but you had nothing to do with that action.",7,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,That does not mean that you were like responsible for your friend's actions.,8,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,It doesn't mean that you did anything wrong.,9,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,It doesn't even mean that you necessarily support that.,10,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Or, as a better example, I did not personally vote for donald trump and I do not agree with anything that he ever has or will do most likely, I do not think that I should be held responsible for the decision-making process that he goes through therefore.",11,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So this is very clear because when you're talking about the nuclear bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki, you're not just talking about incidental civilian casualties as a result of launching a rocket into a hamas a a military target run by hamas.",12,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Although that may not be all that great either, there's a couple of key distinctions.",13,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"First and foremost, there's the degree and totality of harm that you are levying against someone.",14,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"You're not just taking out small tactical military targets, you're trying to wipe an entire city off of the face of the earth, and that is certainly a much greater moral harm that you're imposing on civilians like tens of thousands of civilians that you are killing in one stroke is completely different.",15,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"But secondarily, I think that there is also a difference between intent to cause harm to civilians and the incidental or collateral harm that happens to civilians.",16,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Because if you are attacking primarily military targets and there's incidental civilians, obviously that's bad, but that's more along the lines of unfortunate than you taking an affirmatively bad action.",17,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"In the same way in which it like it's obviously not good if you hit someone like accidentally in a car accident or things like that or things like that, like that may not be good, but that's not the same as premeditated murder.",18,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that's what in a lot of ways a nuclear bombing is.,19,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,It's the intentional targeting of a civilian for target for destruction.,20,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So so two things: the degree of harm and the intent to cause civilians specifically harm are reasons why this is just so atrocious, something that we cannot possibly defend.",21,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,Let's look at this in conjunction of a hypothetical about preferable alternatives.,22,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, it is possible that the japanese would have surrendered anyway as a result of standard bombing practices, of standard military procedures and things like that.",23,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"It's also in the at least in the historical record, a very high degree of likelihood that one of the sticking points for the japanese is they wanted to retain their emperor and certain like vestiges of their prior systems as a condition of surrender.",24,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"And you know, in my opinion, that's a pretty reasonable condition of surrender, certainly not something that warrants dropping nuclear bombs on people.",25,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So the US, if this deal did exist, should've accept that position perfectly fine.",26,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe that deal didn't exist, maybe you still had to participate in a ground invasion of the island.",27,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, you know what, I still think that's fine.",28,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,At the end of the day maybe more US soldiers would have died.,29,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"US soldiers consent into the possibility of death, especially in world war two.",30,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"There's an agreed-upon principle that if you're fighting in a war, you're possibly putting your life on the line.",31,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"That's not something that a civilian is consenting into, and I think that in a lot of ways it's woefully inadequate to just say just because someone is american, their life values more to an american government, especially given that you're talking about less civilian deaths.",32,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,That's always something that should outweigh.,33,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So for those reasons, very proud to oppose.",34,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,We think the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were justified and they were justified for three main reasons.,1,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"One, that the japanese were ultimately instigators of the conflict in the first place.",2,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"Two, there were no reasonably a reasonable alternative courses of action.",3,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"And three, that ultimately this would achieve benefits in the long run by accomplishing future deterrence.",4,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start with japanese instigation.",5,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"Obviously, the japanese initiated a war against the united states by attacking pearl harbor.",6,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"So, why is this important?",7,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,The reason is that the united states was now necessarily entered into a war against japan and it had to fight japan.,8,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"And this is important because when it chose to attack hiroshima and nagasaki, those targets were picked as ultimately more industrialized and productive cities.",9,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"So by attacking those cities, they ultimately eliminated their ability to eliminated their ability to have more productive power, which hurt japan's military capacity.",10,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"But it also hurt the morale of japan in a very unique way, which ultimately was more likely to contribute to a war in which america did not start in the first place, but was forced to confront otherwise.",11,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, I don't ultimately think that you can even really assign moral harm here, because there are no real alternatives.",12,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"Because recognize that an invasion would not only be costly, but would likely accomplish the exact same in terms of civilian casualties as as well.",13,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"So when you look at the cost that this would have on american lives, this is something that we simply can't understate.",14,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"The soldiers that would be dying, possibly in the tens of thousands, each individual one of them is an american life, someone who probably has a family back home, or at the very least a whole future of their life to live.",15,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"This is what america has an obligation to protect, and if they can make a decision that would save countless american lives, they should definitely do that, and they should especially do that if there's no even real guarantee that there's going to be a difference in civilian casualties.",16,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"This is true because if it weren't for the unique terrorizing nature of the nuclear bombs, it's possible that a prolonged military occupancy would have been necessary, and essentially a US conquest of the entire continent piece by piece.",17,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"That would have required fire bombings of cities, fire bombings of plants across the area of where workers were, there would have been widespread damage anyway.",18,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"These are all casualties that would have likely arisen anyway, there likely would have been rebellions and uprisings, all things that would have resulted in a whole lot of damage and harms as well.",19,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"But, we finally want to talk about the future deterrence effect that this has, because I think that this is incredibly important as well.",20,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,And I think that this is important because the use of nuclear weapons made it more likely that you're not going to see nuclear weapons used in the future.,21,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"And I think this is true because of the way human beings think, and the way human beings act.",22,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"They're visually they're visual thinkers and they when they see something that is visually powerful, something like a tragedy that fold before their eyes, or something that has tremendous human casualty, things like with the radiation and the likes of the bomb.",23,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,I think that what this ultimately accomplishes is a much more powerful aversion to that.,24,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"So this is why when you just hear statistics about tens of thousands of deaths in a place like syria, that's ultimately a lot less powerful than looking at actual pictures of the carnage that you see there.",25,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,You're because because what it does is it evokes a base human instinct a base human emotional connection.,26,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"So I think this is incredibly important, because obviously there was a whole lot of devastation and damage from the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki.",27,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"What I ultimately think this led to though, is more of a human aversion to nuclear of nuclear weapons, and I think this is one of the big reasons why we haven't seen anyone actually be willing to use a nuclear weapon.",28,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,So at the end of the day this could've actually saved a whole lot more lives and made the world a whole lot more stable in the long run.,29,,
DJ_2103_atomic-bombing_pro.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, I think it's quite clear the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki were justified.",30,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Television does more good than harm for two main reasons: first because all of the alleged harms are ultimately utter nonsense that aren't actually specific to television but more so specific to human nature itself and secondarily because television is an incredibly enriching part of the human experience.,1,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,It can enhance the human existence and your very life itself.,2,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, first, why do I actually not think that there is that many great harms that are associated with television?",3,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, whether it's allegations that it leads to laziness or encourages procrastination or encourages obesity or this other an entire parade of horrors that are associated with television, I don't actually think that that's really specific to television.",4,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"I think that human beings oftentimes look for look for a means or a mode by which to actualize on them not wanting to do unpleasant things like their work, maybe, or not wanting to do, like, unpleasant things like their like, something else in their life and TV is merely the outlet by which they choose to do so.",5,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"People could read books instead of people could read books that also have cliffhanger endings oftentimes at the end of chapters if they don't want to do their work, people can play video games if they don't want to do these kinds of things, so I actually think that there's a whole lot of unique offense there.",6,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"And the same is often true of the content itself, because when people allege that, oh, while they people try to make money off the fact, sex and violence sells, obviously this is the same in other mediums too, like when you look at books like fifty shades of gray.",7,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,it's hard to say that this isn't also the way in which this sells in other mediums as well.,8,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, none of the harms that are allegedly associated with television are all that specific to television themselves, however, the benefits that come with television are quite unique and important to television.",9,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, what are the reasons why television is great for the human experience?",10,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"I think that there are two big areas of argumentation under this, the first of which is that the act of watching television itself in a lot of ways, irrespective of the content, the act of watching television itself is good for people's mental health in that it stimulates relaxation.",11,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"it's essentially just turning off, and it's turning off and going into like another world in a lot of ways after a day, whether it's like you're watching a TV show that you like or you're watching sports.",12,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"it essentially creates a very easy window of entertainment for you, entertainment that is oftentimes quite necessary when you're on a weekend or after a long days of work, something that's incredibly important for your own well-being in life and something that we shouldn't overlook in society.",13,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But in addition to the act itself of watching TV being relaxing and enriching, I also think that a lot of the content itself oftentimes gets a bad reputation and can be quite good.",14,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, first and foremost, it's just obvious that, while maybe you can argue that at worst, some television is bad, that doesn't really make a whole lot of sense or is all that compelling, because there's also a whole lot of very good television that I'm sure a whole lot of people watch and appreciate as well.",15,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"certainly, I think the television that I watch is rather good, and of course sports are very.",16,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"sports are great, so those are like good to watch too.",17,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But I think that in a lot of ways, the stories that come out of it, the stories and narratives that come out of TV shows, can be incredibly enriching for your lives.",18,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"they can, like, teach you about other worlds that you haven't experienced.",19,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,they can teach you about other experiences that you haven't experienced.,20,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"they can be funny, they can be sad, they can tap into your emotions, things that are incredibly important parts of your lives, things that can be incredibly entertaining.",21,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"They also can just bring more enjoyment to your life, they can bring more perspective to your life on certain things because oftentimes, TV shows can be incredibly educational by teaching you perspectives that you haven't experienced before because TV shows are oftentimes at, like, the various perspectives of people in society.",22,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"They're the perspective of a police officer, the perspective of a lawyer, the perspective of a minority.",23,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"You can oftentimes learn a whole lot of different things from, like, a narrative-based show that oftentimes comes from TV.",24,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, I think that you can learn a whole lot from the stories, you can learn a whole lot from the society which it comes out of, these kinds of things.",25,,
DJ_2104_television_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, I think at the end of the day, television certainly does more good than harm, especially because in addition to the obvious good, there isn't a whole lot of harm that can be directly attributed to television anyway.",26,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Now, casinos don't bring more harm than good.",1,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"There's first, nothing really wrong with gambling, I think it's something that people have the right to do with their money and it doesn't, I don't think, cause all that much of a harm.",2,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"A lot of the harms that they may talk about are, I think, not directly associated with gambling.",3,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that secondarily, even if that's not true, having a a legal entity like a casino to have associating with gambling is ultimately better than it being an unregulated, under the table industry.",4,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about gambling.",5,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because I think honestly that people have a right to gamble, so you should give them a legal opportunity to do it in a place like a casino.",6,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that people have a right to do it because it's people's money, and people should have the right to, if they work hard for their money, they own that money, it's theirs, they can do what they want with it.",7,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"In the same way in which you can decide what you want to purchase with your money, I see no reason why you can't wager your money, risk your money in a game, for more money just like I within the grasp of your freedom of choice.",8,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"I think particularly this is important, because in a lot of ways it's not even philosophically distinct from other perfectly legal activities, like investing in the stock market or in investment in general.",9,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Investing is just putting more money up front in for the purpose of getting money.,10,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"The only difference is maybe to some extent it's a calculated risk, but sometimes that's the same of gambling too, like poker is a game of skill in a lot of ways, so this is a really, in a lot of ways, a hypocritical standard and an unfair one.",11,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"If people want to gamble with their money, why not, that's fine, they can do what they want with it.",12,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But I think that additionally, it's important to recognize that gambling spending your money up for gambling isn't necessarily even an irrational decision, because a lot of people just enjoy it.",13,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"People enjoy playing poker, people enjoy playing blackjack, maybe people even enjoy playing the slots, it's like relaxing to them, or there's a thrill from gambling.",14,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"You know what, those are subjective preferences and there's no reason why we should decide what people there's there's no reason why we should care about what people value in their lives, what people see as the value of the money that they have.",15,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But even if that isn't true, I still think that casinos don't do more harm than good, because without casinos you would still have gambling, it would just be black market gambling.",16,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that this is quite likely to be exist.,17,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We already see the in the status quo oftentimes a lot of under the table gambling.,18,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Internet gambling is a huge huge market already.,19,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And this is important because you it's not necessarily as safe, you don't know, there's not as maybe maybe as much as like security, there's also not as many like maybe mechanisms who check against like cheating or misleading of the people who are involved in betting their money.",20,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And finally you can't even like profit off of the industry via taxation, so you definitely you can't.",21,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"It's like a good a casino is oftentimes a good source of revenue for government, so you definitely want it to be legal if people are going to want to do this anyway.",22,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Additionally, I also think that this pushes people into less dubious but similar practices as alternatives, like you could see things like daily fantasy football, which is in a lot of ways very similar, people can use that as a substitute for gambling.",23,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that and that's oftentimes worse in a lot of ways.,24,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So I really think that it's important that you take a look at this in this totality that not only is it really not so bad that people spend their money in the way that they choose, but without casinos, gambling just will happen anyway, but you'll just see it in a much less safe way.",25,,
DJ_2105_casinos_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for those reasons, very proud to oppose.",26,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"Immigration to the united states brings more good than harm for two big reasons: first, it brings a lot of good to americans and this, from a self interested perspective, it's good for our economy in that it's good for jobs, it's good for the economy.",1,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"And secondarily, it's good because it's the moral thing to do.",2,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"It's just the right thing to do as a liberal society, a democratic society in which we just have more, are fortunate enough to have more.",3,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about self interest.",4,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,And I think this one is pretty clear.,5,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"Immigration is incredibly good for the US economy it provides a boost to the amount of people in the workforce, it provides a boost to consumption.",6,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,This is why a lot of like economists are oftentimes very concerned with population growth.,7,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,Because it's something that's just important to the like healthy maintenance of an economy and this is something that is important to all americans.,8,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,It's important to all americans to make sure that the economy stays strong.,9,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,Additionally I think that they're also helpful in that in the jobs that they are able to provide.,10,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"I think that they're helpful in the fact that they often do jobs that americans don't wanna do and that this means that these jobs, which are still important, are getting done.",11,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"And the final, the third and final reason why I think that it's good for americans though is that I think it's good from a cultural perspective.",12,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"I think that when you have like a diversity of people that you're encountering on a day to day basis when you're experiencing different cultures whether it's through food or friendships or celebrations, I think that in a lot of ways this leads to a more like enriching understanding of the world and a more enriching life in general, and more enjoyable one too at that.",13,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,So now that now going on to the second argument: the argument about how this is simply just the moral thing to do.,14,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"So, it's important to understand that immigration is something that is incredibly difficult to do.",15,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"It's difficult in that it's oftentimes just financially difficult it's difficult to get the money to do that, to just pack up and go somewhere else, try to get a new life.",16,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"It's difficult emotionally, you're oftentimes leaving down what you've been most comfortable with your whole life, you could be leaving behind family members, close friendships, to go somewhere possibly very far away and finally it's also bad just logistically.",17,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"It's difficult to make the move, it's difficult to maybe learn a new language, learn a new culture.",18,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,It's very difficult to be an immigrant.,19,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"So, all of this should be taken into consideration when we want to ask this question.",20,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,If it's so hard why do people do it?,21,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,And I think the reason people do it is because they feel a need to do that.,22,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"Whether it's a security need in some circumstances, people come from countries that are ravaged by war or violence and they fleet to places like united states for safety and security.",23,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,There is also the possibility of them fleeting from poverty and trying to get more economic prosperity in somewhere like america.,24,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"Whatever their reasons may be, given how hard it is to emigrate, we should recognize that people don't do this just on a whim and that people are trying to come out of oftentimes very bad situations.",25,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,"And when somebody is trying to come to america, if we're a country that wants to actually just help people, if we're a country that wants to do the right thing, and we should bring allow immigrants to come in.",26,,
DJ_2106_immigration-usa_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons very proud to propose this motion.,27,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"We should cancel the social security tax, and we should cancel it not because it is ideal in its current form, but because of any alternatives that could possibly exist would be inferior.",1,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Any feasible alternatives would simply not be good enough, and social security is so important to so many people.",2,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"It is necessary, therefore, that we keep and await it.",3,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,First let's start by talking about some of the things that we would defend.,4,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"We think it's perfectly comfortable that since we're defending the side of keeping the social security tax as it currently is, we can still defend minor changes, for example, ending the contribution caps and things like that that make it a more financially salient solution to the baby boomer problem.",5,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, now that this has been established, let's talk about why social security is so important to the lives of so many senior citizens.",6,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Recognize that before the passage of social security by the FDR administration, millions upon millions of senior citizens died in poverty, with no money at all to their name.",7,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because senior citizens do not as they are retired, obviously, don't have money to take care of themselves.",8,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,They don't have a way to generate income and they don't have a way to just take care of themselves in very basic ways.,9,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So this puts them in a position of extreme dependency out of no fault of their own, simply out of biological necessity.",10,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But, additionally, the money that seniors make and the money that seniors save becomes less valuable over time as goods become more expensive and as inflation rises, so maybe and additionally, as minimum wage laws and things like that also generally progress.",11,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So this is important because it means that even if you made a good amount of money in your living, it's still difficult to save that money because you're going to have.",12,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"even if you save your money up, you're still not going to have enough money likely to afford the basic things that you need to enjoy a good quality of life once you become a senior citizen.",13,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, now that we've established that social security is incredibly important, let's next talk about why it is necessary that we keep it in the form it is.",14,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So first, I think it's highly unlikely that we would ever actually see a more progressive system like the one that our government described, and I think the reason for this is because the political incentives against social security are oftentimes already incredibly large and that there is not that many more incentives to do those kinds of things.",15,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,I think that the much more likely scenario that we would see play out would be a privatization scheme.,16,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, this would be absolutely horrible, and it would be absolutely horrible for several reasons.",17,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"First and foremost, I think that when you create a profit motive for this industry, rather than relying on the government to make investments and not having to worry about profit, when you have a profit seeking industry taking care of this, they're more likely to take higher risk investments, and they'll take those higher risk investments because they have a possible promise of a higher payout.",18,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Now, this may sound okay because it means that senior citizens are going to get more money, but I ultimately think that this is a big problem because when you're taking a risk with someone else's money, you are additionally also likely to be less careful with this.",19,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So this is incredibly bad because I think that what this will likely therefore end up doing is whenever you get to a time of a recession or even in non-times of recession, you're going to have people taking risks with senior citizens' life savings, things that they depend on to survive, and that's simply not something that we can accept, so that's not going to work.",20,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But additionally, privatization is also going to be more expensive for people",21,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"because even if you're not going to have to pay the social security tax or the like, you're still going to have to take things like manager fees you have to pay, usually like basis points off of like basis points off of the money that you make or investments that you make and things like that",22,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And oftentimes because of the higher costs of operating for the private sector and about how they have to make the profit, you're going to have to pay more for the exact same service that you're getting.",23,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So this is going to hurt poor people, and this is really bad because these poor people are the ones who rely on social security the most.",24,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But finally, I don't think that the using employer-funded systems are a very good solution because as we see in the status quo, employer funded pensions can oftentimes be ended or cut prematurely, which additionally leads to the harm that we are talking about to a whole lot of people.",25,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, we should definitely not cancel the social security tax.",26,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"We should cancel the social security tax and we should cancel it immediately, because it is a rights violation.",1,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,And it is a rights violation that has no countervailing justification and it is not legitimized by any actual need for it.,2,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So before I get into that, I want to clarify the grounds of what we're discussing here today.",3,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"Because I think that the motion is very clear in that it says we should cancel the social security tax, not cancel the FICA tax, so therefore we're perfectly fine defending the status quo with regards to the FICA tax still existing, although albeit at a likely lower rate, in order to collect money for things like medicare and medicaid.",4,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So now that we've established that, let's talk about why social security is problematic and it the tax needs to be ended.",5,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,So obviously the social security tax is rights violating.,6,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"It's rights violating in the fact that the money that you earn is the result of your work, it's the result of your labor, and a big reason why the state exists in the first place is to ensure the protection of your property and to enable that, by things like whether contracts or police forces and things like that.",7,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"The reason the state exist by and large is to preserve the protection of your property, which means that it probably shouldn't take your money away from you, money that is rightfully yours unless it has a pretty good reason for doing so.",8,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So now let's talk about why we don't think that with regards to the social security tax, there is a pretty good reason for doing so.",9,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So the first reason I don't believe I believe that this is true, is because I don't actually think that you can have a right to social security in no way that you could have rights to other things.",10,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So I'm not going to deny that you should have a right to things like your health, right to things like your safety, a right to things like food and shelter.",11,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"However, that's not what social security is about.",12,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"Social security is essentially just money that you get, a fund that you get as a result of either being just a retiree, or certain kinds of disabilities, or a widow status or other other extenuating circumstances like that.",13,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"But by and large it resolves around simply old age, and I don't think the fact that you are simply old, combined with the simply old, actually necessitates that you have a right to this money.",14,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,And the reason I think that's true is because I don't think that you can have a right to money.,15,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"You can only have a right to certain things, because those are what ultimately impacts your life.",16,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"Maybe if you are a senior citizen and you are struggling to provide yourself with healthcare, then you should have the right to medicare.",17,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"If you're a senior citizen who is struggling to be able to provide yourself with food, then the government can exist to offer programs to help you with food, something that you have a right to.",18,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"But I don't think that you have a right to anyone else's money just in the form of their money, that you could spend in any way you want whatsoever.",19,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So the next the next reason why we should cancel the social security tax is because I don't actually think there's any need for it, and if there is no need to take money from people, you probably shouldn't do that.",20,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So the first reason why there's no need is because oftentimes there's already either alternatives or supplements to social security anyway, in the forms of individual pension plans that come from a lot of different entities.",21,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"Oftentimes companies offer pension plans, most government they offer pension plans, a lot of union workers get pension plans, so a lot of people got pension plans.",22,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, even if there's no pension plans existing, simply oftentimes by responsible saving and smart investing, you can still ensure that you're going to be able to have a reasonable enough amount of savings so you're able to take care of yourself throughout the duration of your life, something that is honestly in a lot of ways pretty doable.",23,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, it's quite clear that, while there is a clear loss of rights when you're taking away money from people, there's no real reason why you have to do it because you don't have a right to money.",24,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"you only have a right to certain benefits that are necessary for your survival, maybe, and you also oftentimes have other alternatives to social security that don't make its tax collection necessary.",25,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,it's not the same thing as like police officers or things like that.,26,,
DJ_2109_social-security-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, we're incredibly proud to cancel the social security tax.",27,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,We should lower the age of consent for two big reasons.,1,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"First, we should lower it because this is an individual choice that people should have the right to make and secondarily, we should lower it because the way in which it's applied is ultimately used to just target the relationships of young people.",2,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about choice.,3,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,I think that obviously the underpinning of a democratic free society like america is one in which there is a presumption of individual choice and individual freedom.,4,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,You should be able to make life choices of what you want to do what you think is important to you as long as this isn't actually hurting other people.,5,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"So I think that this is very important because this is why it's specifically important that people have the freedom to make choices that they want when it's in terms of who they love, who they have sex with, who they have a relationship with, and I think that that's particularly important because those are the kinds of relationships or interactions that first are uniquely personal.",6,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,They're the ones that are going to be the least harmful to other people and they're the ones that aren't actually going to do those things.,7,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"Second, they're also incredibly personal in the fact that they mean a lot to the individual person.",8,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,They are very being able to like be with the person that you love is an incredibly important thing to individual people.,9,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,So those are all important things and finally because of rational consent because of the fact that this is a perfectly reasonable decision.,10,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,By the time that you got to like consent ages are oftentimes now at like eighteen and sixteen.,11,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"Presumably a few years earlier, maybe by the time someone gets to high school, they're already prepared to like date people, to hook up with people.",12,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,These are things that reasonable decisions to make and I think it's important to note this as for why this is the case is because oftentimes there's already like education on this.,13,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"People are already getting sex ed by then, but I think additionally it's not like it's takes all of the maturity in the world to like date people.",14,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,This isn't necessarily something that is so important that it's something that we have to regulate.,15,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,I think that we should just defer to individual choice on this one.,16,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"But the second line of argumentation I wanna advance is about the way in which ages of consent are applied in practice to actually hurt people because I think that the traditional scary example that we all think of with respect to the age of consent is like this thirty year old guy trying to date this twelve year old girl, is actually not a very common one.",17,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,It's not the way in which this usually happens.,18,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,It's quite rare that this actually happens and I think that that would also still presumably be criminalized on our side of the house.,19,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"I think that the problem that we're talking about, though, is that what this oftentimes results and is maybe like high schooler a senior in high school dating a freshman in high school, or a junior in college dating a senior in high school, maybe, or those kinds of relationships where they're ultimately not a very big age gap,",20,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"it's a small age gap in a lot of cases,",21,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,but it happens to be sat under a few critical years that are on different sides of the ban,22,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,And this bright line is therefore just something that's inherently arbitrary.,23,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"It's not one that has any real meaning, because once you turn like a couple of days older or a year older, you're not getting any like more reasonable measure of maturity or anything like that.",24,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"but what does ultimately does is this bright line: does criminalize people who are in these kinds of relationships, and I think that's something that is quite bad.",25,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,"and because that just constitutes more of these relationships that are still illegal, I think that those are the ones that are more likely targeted by these kinds of policies like the, the age of consent being higher.",26,,
DJ_2110_age-of-consent_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons very proud to propose.,27,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not further exploit green technology for a couple of big reasons: first, we shouldn't exploit it because green technology is incredibly expensive and that this would be very exclusive to a whole lot of people in society and secondarily we shouldn't bother spending money on this because it's grossly unnecessary and we can better spend the money on other things.",1,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about the first thing, why green technology is just like a waste of money, it's too expensive.",2,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Obviously, green technology is, by and large, at its like early stage, and this isn't a debate about we.",3,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,this isn't like we should never exploit green technology.,4,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,this is like further do it right now.,5,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"and that's important because right now, green technology is still in its infancy, it is still way more expensive than conventional technologies and it's by and large, not ready and it's constantly improving and being replaced.",6,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, the first impact in this is that a lot of green technology is like a waste of investment because it's going to be replaced very soon anyway.",7,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, you don't want to invest in an entire system of energy organization if you're only going to have to replace it ten years later when the grid is going to work in a completely different way or this all gets outdated.",8,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, this isn't like a road where it's going to more or less stay the same for most of like recent history.",9,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Like these technologies change very rapidly.,10,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"That's like why you don't want to put like like you wouldn't have wanted to put an archaic computer every single person's classroom right before newer computers are gonna come out, that would work a whole lot better.",11,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So like reason number one why we shouldn't like use green technology all right now.,12,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,", additionally there's the cost element associated with green technology.",13,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Like obviously green technology is really expensive.,14,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So that's bad because like even if you believe that green technology is like better in some way or superior in some way you're excluding a lot of like poor people or in especially in all of like developing countries from the green technology and the reason for this because they're just not going to have the money or capability to invest in a lot of these technologies.,15,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, that's going to be really really bad for them.",16,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,", additionally I think that the exploitation of green technology is by and large unnecessary.",17,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,", global warming isn't going to be all that bad.",18,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Like we can just like use human ingenuity and human engineering to get out of all of the impacts of global warming.,19,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like we can build levees or we can like engineer food so it grows in hotter temperatures and things like that, like none of this stuff is all that bad so there's no real reason to be greener.",20,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,I think cheaper is a whole lot more important because there's like a subjective value of human life element here and like some people may like the idea of things being greener but like not green things are pretty awesome.,21,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, it's nice when your oil is available and cheap because cheap and available oil means public transportation is cheaper, it means your plastics are cheaper, it means your car is cheaper, your travel is cheaper your commute to work is cheaper.",22,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Like all of these it like it affects every aspect of your life.,23,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,We can't just like poo poo away that.,24,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,", it's important to recognize the way which this affects people.",25,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,And I don't think this is all that necessary urgent anyway as a point of comparison.,26,,
DJ_2122_green-technology_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we shouldn't bother further exploiting green technology.,27,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,We should ban alcoholic beverages because of the incredible harm they do to people on a daily basis and the necessity of fixing that problem with an extreme and direct action in order to fix the many ways which people get hurt on a daily basis by alcohol.,1,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,And I think that a ban is therefore a good solution.,2,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about what the actual harms of alcohol are.",3,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,Because I think that they come in two ways.,4,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"First, there's a lot of inherent harms that are associated with alcohol.",5,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,Alcohol hurt people's health in a very direct way.,6,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"It like hurts people's liver, it hurt people's brains it can cause heart problems, there's all kinds of ways in which alcohol can alcohol can actually just like impede on your health.",7,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,And this is bad because this causes a lot of harms for society at large.,8,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"This requires people not being able to be workers, possibly people being reliant on like, the healthcare system and things like that, people needing access to like doctors and things like that, and all of that is certainly a drain.",9,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,That's also a drain on individual people alone.,10,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,It's also harmful to individual people.,11,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,So we don't want people to make these decisions if they're going bad decisions.,12,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, there's also facilitative problems with alcohol.",13,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"It facilitates a lot of problems, in that when you drink alcohol, you're more likely to commit violent crimes, you're more likely to do things that are dangerous or reckless, like drive drunk or things like that, and obviously these things are very bad and making them illegal is fine.",14,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"making them a illegal is helpful,",15,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"but it doesn't solve the root cause of the problem,",16,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,because I think that if we're willing to make things like driving under the influence illegal and if we're for willing to make things like like drinking in public illegal,17,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"because we know that it could possibly lead to like violence or things like that or disorderly conduct, I think that if we are willing to make those things illegal, it's",18,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,we think that those things are quite bad,19,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"and I think, if you think those things are quite bad, we also need to do what we can to eliminate the root causes of those things, which could be alcohol.",20,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"So, given that all of that is true, obviously, why do I think that a ban is a good way to actually make sure that this works?",21,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"Because recognize that, it's not important that by banning something you're going to get a hundred percent compliance, obviously if you ban alcohol, some people are still going to find ways to drink alcohol, but the problem is that's not the way the harms work.",22,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"Cause if we can even make that number a good deal lower or even a little bit lower, that's still saving people from liver problems, it's still seating people from possibly violent incidents or violent car accidents because of someone driving drunk.",23,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"If we can even like solve that a little bit, that's still a really good thing.",24,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"Because I think that, the social stigma power that comes with banning something is incredibly important.",25,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,I think that people are just going to be more afraid of doing things because they're banned.,26,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,it's going to be more of a perception of danger against these things that it's going to be bad.,27,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,there's no longer going to be this active glorification.,28,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"you're not gonna see people on TV shows as much like maybe like in like a TV show just publicly drinking, or in like commercials for beer, things like that.",29,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"all these things that normalize alcohol, all of that is going to disappear.",30,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that, through time that's going to result in a different percentage of different perspective on alcohol usage.",31,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,And I think that overall that's going to be good.,32,,
DJ_2123_alcoholic-beverages_pro.trs.txt,"So, for all those reasons, very proud to propose.",33,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,We should subsidize higher education for two big reasons.,1,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"First, we should subsidize it because it's very good for the economy overall and secondarily, we should subsidize it because, on the more individual level, it's also obviously economically good, but it's also very important for social mobility and individual empowerment.",2,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about what we mean by subsidizing higher education.",3,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"Obviously, subsidizing higher education does not necessarily mean entirely free education.",4,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"However, obviously, we are going to defend a world in which we substantially increase public subsidies for higher education, compared to the status quo.",5,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,We also don't think that this necessarily has to be available to everyone.,6,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"We think that we're we're perfectly comfortable in giving out greater subsidies in the forms of greater need-based aid, rather than just more general lowering of prices of education, and also increasing the extent and availability of public loans for education.",7,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"Oftentimes in the status quo, public loans for higher education have much more generous terms of repayment and much more generous interest rates than private loans do, and but they're oftentimes not available to give as much money which fully covers the cost of public education.",8,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,So that's another thing which we want to correct for.,9,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"So, why is subsidizing higher education good for the economy?",10,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"When you exist in a highly developed country, you predominately are going to see your economy be a service sector based economy or a more technologically focused based economy.",11,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,And this creates a problem because it means that there's going to be a lack of a comparative lack of cheaper labor-based jobs or cheaper manufacturing-based jobs.,12,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"This means that oftentimes the economy necessarily requires that most people have a higher degree of education, a higher extent of education for working in just like higher quality jobs.",13,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,So this means that a necessary condition of your employment is oftentimes going to be getting a college education.,14,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,And in the same way in which the reason why we fund low primary and secondary school is because those are necessary parts of your employment in a lot of cases.,15,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,This is very similar for higher education so that makes sense too.,16,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"So, we obviously don't want a whole bunch of people unemployed, because a whole bunch of people unemployed is lost productivity, and it's also just a drain on resources which isn't very good either.",17,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, this is also important because there's going to be when you don't have as much money that you're making, you're also just going to have less money that you're going to be able to pay for things.",18,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"So, when you have a higher paying job work or if you're more educated, you're gonna make more money, and that means you're going to be able to consume more, which is also good for the economy.",19,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"Additionally, and this also ties in to the feasibility point, we think that this is going to be a long-term investment that is going to pay off.",20,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"And it's going to pay off because more and more people are going to once they're like better educated are they're able to work better jobs, they're able to innovate more, this is going to be better for the economy so this is going to cover the costs of the subsidizing more.",21,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"But we additionally, in the short term, think that there is certainly available money for this.",22,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,Maybe just spend less on the military and more on education and helping people.,23,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,That sounds pretty good to me.,24,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"So, the next thing that I want to talk about is about individual empowerment of people.",25,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"And on the individual level, it is still often too difficult and too inaccessible to afford a college education.",26,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"And this is particularly true given that college education around the world, but particularly in america, sees its expenses rising rapidly which prices out a whole lot of people, even people in the middle class.",27,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,And this creates a big problem,28,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"because it means that you're oftentimes- if you're not able to even afford college, you're locked into essentially the cycle of poverty: or you're not going to be able to have as engaging discussions, or you're not gonna be able to have as like engaging an educated population as well, which means you're also more likely to have foolish political decisions, like the election of donald trump or denying climate change or things like that",29,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"So it's very important on the individual level as well to make sure that people can go to college, to make sure that they're productive intelligent and beneficial citizens and so that they can be empowered to break out of the cycle of poverty.",30,,
DJ_2124_higher-education_pro.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, we definitely think that you should subsidize higher education.",31,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not ban organic food quite simply because people should have the freedom to choose what kind of food they want to eat in accordance with their preferences, especially if this doesn't actually cause any reasonable harm or any kind of provable harm, which there isn't attached to organic food.",1,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So let's break this down.,2,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,I think that there is a quite obvious and enshrined freedom in any kind of liberal and rights oriented society to pick the kind of food that you want to eat.,3,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,You have the freedom to decide if you want to go to an italian restaurant or a mexican restaurant.,4,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,You have the freedom to decide if you want a lemonade or a coca cola.,5,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,You have the freedom to pick what kinds of foods you want to eat because people have different kinds of preferences and it's a really basic way that people satisfy their preferences.,6,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,There's no real reason to regulate that all that much.,7,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So why does this apply?,8,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Why does this basic principle apply to organic organic food?,9,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,There's three reasons why I think that this is true.,10,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"First and foremost, people can have a very reasonable preference for organic food because they see it as more humane.",11,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"The association with factory farming because oftentimes organic food, even if it's not necessarily done in like the most humane way possible, although oftentimes there is a correlation between organic eggs and free range eggs and things like that, there tends to be a correlation between the two.",12,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"People may not be willing to be like fully vegetarian or things like that, people may still like to enjoy meat and dairy and things like that.",13,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But that doesn't mean that they appreciate factory farming, nor does it mean that they support the torturing of animals or things like that.",14,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So people may on basic moral grounds want to have organic food and this is certainly something that people should have the right to.,15,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,People should have the right to opt into a moral framework that they wish to participate in.,16,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Secondarily, people should have the right to eat organic food because people may just like the taste of organic food better.",17,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"When my opponent talks about how factory farming can be more efficient and about how you can use the space more effectively, grow bigger food, blah blah blah.",18,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe I don't want a tomato the size of my head and I prefer a tomato the size of my fist because oftentimes the nutrients that get pumped into it or the the way in which it's manufactured in order to have the food reach that size, a certain kind of taste gets lost.",19,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"A certain kind of quality can get lost, and this is something that's very subjective.",20,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,It's oftentimes difficult to quantify.,21,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But if people think that what the food they are eating taste better, people think that they're experiencing a greater enjoyment out of their food, then this is certainly something that people should have the right to consume.",22,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"There's no reason to take it away from them people can choose to pay more money for that if they want to, who really cares?",23,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,The third and final reason is health-related reasons.,24,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, this is also something that's very clear.",25,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"You can try to make arguments that without like the more uniform safety standards and things like that, organic foods aren't actually all that safe, blah, blah, blah, blah blah.",26,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"this is at very least a wash in comparable to the fact that if you get a singular outbreak of like salmonella at one of the three tyson chicken factories, you're more likely to see a much broader scope of damage.",27,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,so that probably cancels out.,28,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,but there's also the additional health harms when you're pumping pesticides into something.,29,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe people don't want to have to worry about the fact that a lot of these pesticides or things can be possibly carcinogenic, that they could lead to other kinds of health problems, that they can lead to you being more likely to get diabetes or other kinds of diseases.",30,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,These are all reasonable concerns that people may have and people certainly should have the right to make those decisions.,31,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,And this is especially true because there's no real documentable harm of organic food.,32,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"It's just more expensive, it's not any less safe compared to other kinds of food.",33,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should not ban organic food.",34,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,We should let people pick the food they want to eat and eat what they want.,35,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,We should ban organic food for a simple reason.,1,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,It is less safe than conventionally produced foods.,2,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"So in order to establish why this is true, when I first talk about how this about how organic food is because of the fact that it doesn't use industrial pesticides, and because of the fact that it lacks additives, it's going to make you more likely to be sick.",3,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,The reasons why this is true is for a few reasons.,4,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"First and foremost, the importance of pesticides.",5,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"Pesticides are incredibly important for controlling diseases, whether it's e coli or salmonella or other kinds of naturally food borne diseases.",6,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,This is the reason why you saw the recent disease outbreaks at chipotles across the united states of america that led to numerous health problems for people.,7,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"The reason this is true is because due to the lack of industrial strength pesticides, it's more likely that diseases are going to be able to be kept.",8,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"But furthermore, because of the variant methods it's also more likely that the diseases that the variant methods of manufacturing for these foods in a very growing methods for these foods, it's also more likely that these diseases are going to prop up in different parts of production facilities and are less likely going to be able to be controlled for.",9,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally we also think that the presence of additives in food is important to you because it reduces spoilage, and while spoilage is obviously important for making sure that food can be consumed for a longer period of time, spoilage is also important because spoiled food simply isn't safe to eat, and unsafe food to eat could be quite bad for people.",10,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,So the reason why we think that food safety is obviously incredibly important to consider as an issue is because we don't want people to be getting sick.,11,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"That obviously can lead to strain on public health resources or the individual health resources of people, it leads to less productivity in the workforce, and it's just something that it seems like the government should have an obligation to help people with.",12,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,So why do we think that therefore this risk of organic food being less safe is an unnecessary risk.,13,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"Because theoretically this risk could be outweighed or if it was shown that there were actually long term benefits of consuming organic food, long term benefits like you're less likely to get cancer maybe from these pesticides, you are less likely to get other kinds of long term illnesses that could come from using these manufactured goods.",14,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"So we actually don't think this is very likely though, because while there is rock solid evidence and there is truth to the fact that these pesticides make sure that the food is is more safe in that you're going to be getting less diseases, the science behind the benefits of organic food is quite flimsy.",15,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,There isn't really any clear scientific consensus that there's actually any benefits to organic food.,16,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,So there's no real point to deferring to that logic.,17,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"But even if you don't believe that, even if you do think that there is still benefits to organic food, we don't actually think that the average consumer is going to experience these benefits.",18,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"And the reason for that is because this is dependent on the way in which that food is actually produced, first of all at facilities.",19,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"And this is a problem, because oftentimes facilities will be using varied production means, there's not going to be a unified system like with industrialized farming that is going to ensure quality control for these foods.",20,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"So this means that you're not necessarily going to even get the greater nutritional values or health attractions, because you can't actually confirm that you're going to be getting the organic food that experiences these benefits, even if some organic food does.",21,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,But finally this is also dependent on health regulatory agencies.,22,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,And the problem with this is that health regulatory agencies are oftentimes able to operate outside of the public eye and outside of public scrutiny.,23,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"But the scrutiny that they do not operate away from though is the scrutiny of people, of lobbyists, and the scrutiny of the corporation that they're supposed to regulate.",24,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"Throughout the entire world, especially in developed countries, you see revolving doors of politics, you see people who are former members of the industries become regulators of industries.",25,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,"This is a problem, because it means that it essentially creates a system in which people are misled to buy organic food under the assumption it is healthier for them, and that that in reality it is less safe for them and just cost more money.",26,,
DJ_2125_organic-food_pro.trs.txt,And it is for those reasons we should ban organic food.,27,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not ban abortions, we should keep them legal and we should make sure that they stay safe as well.",1,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Two reasons for this that I'm going to advance.,2,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"They are first and foremost, you should keep them because you have a right to that, and that's important.",3,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And second reason is that it's a safety concern, in that abortions are going to happen anyway, and if they're going to happen anyway, you want them to be legal and safe.",4,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So before I get into that I want to just give a quick overview about some like modulating things, because I think that we're fine defending certain regulation in the south for an abortions.",5,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,obviously I think like things like viability could be a good standard.,6,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"significantly late term abortions maybe aren't necessary or defending unless that the life of the mother is at risk, things like that.",7,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that it's important because motherhood and pregnancy take a significant toll on you, even if your intent is to just put the child up for adoption, the the the timeline for pregnancy can take a lot on you emotionally and physically.",8,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Your body changes, like things that, like you eat, change your mood can change.",9,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"it takes a lot it out of you could be like a stressful and a draining process and all of these things are important and further it could be more difficult to like, maybe do your job.",10,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,at times it could be more difficult to like work.,11,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"you might have to take time off from work and you may not be able to get that time because not all countries have paid medical leave, parental leave.",12,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So these are real concerns that women have when they're deciding if they want to have a children, if they want to go through the pregnancy.",13,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that's important because this is impact that it's having on their bodies.,14,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think when it's a decision that is so intimately and directly affecting your body, you should have a right to make that decision, so that's why women should have the right to make that decision.",15,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that further, as long as we're talking about fetuses that aren't viable, fetuses that are still in the very early development, I don't think that there's a real moral harm to outweigh these bodily autonomy harm against that.",16,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that's a big thing.,17,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"The next argument I want to talk about is safety, because I think that this is also likely to be present.",18,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, I think that abortions are going to happen anyway.",19,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And they're going to happen anyway even if you ban them, because the reason why people get abortions is because maybe they're not emotionally ready for a to have a child, or maybe it was an accidental pregnancy, maybe they don't feel like they are financially capable of supporting a child.",20,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,These are all likely the reasons why people end up getting abortions.,21,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Some people get it just simply because they want to, they don't feel like it, but a lot of times it's it's out of necessity.",22,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that this is therefore important to recognize, because these people are going to have to have abortions anyway.",23,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So if you don't allow it to happen at a safe and legal way, people are more likely to try to access it in less safe ways.",24,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Black market, drugs and black market abortions that are going to be designed to satisfy a demand that is still going to exist, because we're talking about something that is fairly necessary, it's not just the you can't just flip a switch off and people aren't going to need abortions.",25,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So given that we think that this is something that people have a right to anyway, but even if they don't, it's if it's going to happen anyway, the government should facilitate it happening in a safer way.",26,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"For those reasons, we think that you should keep abortions.",27,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,We should ban abortion because ultimately it is immoral.,1,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"It is immoral in the fact that we need to make sure that we value life and the potential for a human life as an incredibly valuable idea and secondarily, because when you're making moral decisions, you should look to probability in cases of probability and uncertainty, you should defer to the least possible harmful alternatives.",2,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"So in the case of abortion, you should defer to making choices that aren't potentially harmful to a human life.",3,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"So, before we get into the meat of this argument though, there are a couple of situations in which it's very clear to make sure where I don't foresee this ban applying.",4,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,I do not foresee this ban applying to cases where an abortion is necessary to save the life of a mother or it is otherwise necessary for the health of the mother.,5,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,I also do not foresee this ban enacting it for some reason the child's health would be at risk and this would be a better solution.,6,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"I also further do not see in cases of rape, for example, abortion should also be allowed in those circumstances, other extenuating circumstances like that.",7,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"Additionally, we also think that it's important to defend a world in which contraceptive access, condom access and sexual education access are much more widespread, better funded and better accessible,",8,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"because, ultimately, these are a lot of the lack of like education on that front or the lack of access to contraceptives for a lot of people are what make, in many cases, abortions necessary in the",9,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"So, now that that is established, let's get into why given those circumstances, abortion is immoral.",10,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"So, it's quite obvious that there is nothing more important than human life.",11,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"Every good thing that you have ever experienced, are experiencing, or will experienced is possible because of this.",12,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"In a way, that is why we look at murder as the worse crime of all crime.",13,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,Because murder is essentially the destruction of your own universe from an individualist prospective.,14,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"When you are murdered, everything that you can experience is dead, there's nothing left for you.",15,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"So, given this, there should be an incredibly high bar towards allowing this to happen.",16,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"And we think that given that there's a lot of circumstances where and given that there is otherwise abortion is a choice, if you take out circumstances where the life of the mother is at risk or where rape was taken place or where you didn't have the financial access to contraceptives or condoms or things like that, ultimately therefore, abortion is just a choice.",17,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"And therefore, since it is a choice, it should be something that can be regulated and regulated in this way, because you're essentially balancing the fact that having a child could be something that maybe you don't want to do or you don't feel ready to do.",18,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"However, even if those are very legitimate concerns, they can't balance against the fact that you're essentially making it so that an entire human life cannot be experience, something that is the ultimate moral harm that outweighs that.",19,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,But the next thing that I want to talk about is about probability and uncertainty.,20,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,So this is very important because one standard that's often discussed when it comes to abortions is the idea of viability.,21,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"And when you're talking about viability, this is in many ways a moving target.",22,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"People don't exactly know when viability does exist, and it's also an ever like increasing range.",23,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"This also presents a problem because where therefore when you should defer against like viability or you don't know exactly what, because it's difficult to like get comprehensive medical understandings of like what a fetus can actually experience as far as like pain or cognition, we would argue that when you're doing this you should defer towards minimizing the possible harms.",24,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"Because the harms that can be experienced from this are quite great, and therefore you should defer against these moral farms.",25,,
DJ_2143_ban-abortions_pro.trs.txt,"So, for all of those reasons, think it's very clear that you should ban abortions.",26,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"We should definitely raise the retirement age because the aging because this is just a problem that is urgent right now, and it's something that we absolutely need to make sure that we fix before it becomes too big of a problem to deal with, and I additionally think that there's not any real or inherent harms to raising the retirement age.",1,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about the urgency.,2,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,Because they think that there's a number of factors that make raising the retirement age something that we have to do immediately.,3,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,There's first the fact there's a lot of aging baby boomers in our society.,4,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"There secondarily a lot of population decline, people aren't having as many children as they used to.",5,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"Third there is a lot of general economic stagnation across a lot of western economies and, finally I also think that the there's there is also an increasing quality of healthcare, which means that people are living longer.",6,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"So all of these things combined create a very bad time, because all of this means that you're going to be having a bunch of healthy people retiring in the very near future who are going to be living for decades longer.",7,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"they could be living for another thirty years, forty years, and that presents a real problem",8,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"because when these programs were instituted, as far is to make them economically feasible, they were implemented with a much shorter time frame in mind,",9,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,because standard retirement age of sixty five back in the nineteen thirties would be pretty reasonable if you only thought you're going to live probably into your sixties or seventies,10,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"But now people are living into their eighties and nineties, and maybe even up to a hundred, and these are all things that the state has to foot the bill for, if you're not going to be able to have enough money raised for this.",11,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"And this creates a really big problem, because you're going to see a lot of things like social security fund going broke, a lot of like insurance backup plans going broke an all of these kinds of things, or people defaulting on their ability to playoff pensions, all of these things that are that could be absolutely catastrophic for elderly people.",12,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think that the only thing that you can do from there is increase the retirement age.",13,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"By increasing the retirement age, you keep more people in the workforce for a longer amount of time while they're healthy.",14,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"You make sure that people aren't settling for getting all these government benefits , unless they're people who truly need them in the later parts of their life, not thirty years before they die.",15,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,All of these things are very important to note.,16,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"So, the other thing I wanna talk about is about why this move of raising the retirement age is, doesn't actually have all that much harm to it.",17,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"So the first thing I wanna talk about other than this is that, you don't have any intrinsic right to retire necessarily like, it's definitely, like the fact that you're getting old doesn't mean that you have necessarily the right to all of these government benefits at any specific time, especially if you are deemed still able to actually do things.",18,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that therefore, we can determine the need that people actually are having these things.",19,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"So, that's important to note.",20,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"And it's important to note because I think that, people, there's no real harm to making people work longer.",21,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"Like, people may be lazy or people may feel tired of their job or people may be old, but that doesn't mean that they still can't work and they still can't do their job for a longer amount of time, for another ten years, since they are going to be living for a long amount of time.",22,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,It just means that people are going to be working longer that's the real harm.,23,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,And I think that most people are still capable of working for a longer amount of time.,24,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that our retirement age as a bright line is inherently arbitrary and foolish anyway, because keep in mind that if you're like a fifty year old coal miner you're probably going to be much more in physical need of retirement than a seven sixty five year old lawyer.",25,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"So, the the bright line with retirement is already arbitrary meaningless as is, we might as well, just make sure that we can raise it so that way it's actually going to be economically feasible.",26,,
DJ_2161_retirement-age_pro.trs.txt,"So, for all those reasons, very proud to propose.",27,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,We should not subsidize public transportation.,1,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,I wanna be very clear about what this looks like.,2,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"This doesn't mean that, in at least our opinion, that we should get rid of public transportation altogether.",3,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,we're merely saying the government shouldn't have control over it.,4,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,the government shouldn't subsidize it.,5,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"we should allow private industries to develop it, maybe have some like regulation over it.",6,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"but as far as the money and fund raising and like cost, benefits and profits are concerned, that should be done in the private level.",7,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So first and foremost let's lay down some facts on the ground.,8,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,The current system that we have isn't working.,9,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Public transportation in the united states is garbage.,10,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,", it's incredibly unreliable, it's incredibly uneffective, it breaks down frequently, it doesn't actually like it's like infrequent and it's also expensive anyways.",11,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"All of these things are absolutely bad, it's old it's outdated, there's just like endless complaints with public transportation in america.",12,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,The status quo is clearly broken.,13,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, why would privatization of public transportation be a whole lot better?",14,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,First and foremost because like private like corporations have just like more money sitting around for a lot of upfront investments on these kinds of things.,15,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,They have less like demands for their money.,16,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Governments have a lot of things they have to do with their money.,17,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"They spend it on security, they have to spend money on like healthcare for like poor people, they have to spend money on like education for like public education like like there is a whole lot of things that governments have to spend money on.",18,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, it's better in which you like you minimize the constraints and like the like the stresses that you put on a government budget because private corporations have a lot of this money sitting around.",19,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Next, corporations are a-political actors, so they don't have to worry about like a a congressional trial every time: "" oh !",20,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,This is like nationalistic government spending.,21,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, when it's a-political in nature, the spending is much more stable, it's easier to fundraise, it's easier to get more money for projects and things like that.",22,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So you're going to get more money going into these project.,23,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,And I think finally the profit motivation for these things makes sure that these public transportation projects are actually done in a sustainable way.,24,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"That's important because that sustainability element implies and the profit element means that they have to make sure that a lot of people are going to use the public transportation and in order to ensure usage, they have to make sure that the quality is better than it is right now.",25,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"They would have to make sure that it's more effective, it's it spread out over a wider area, it's faster, it's more reliable, it can do it all all of these things are gonna be better.",26,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,And all of those things have like pretty good associated side benefits too.,27,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,These things are going to be better for the environment therefore and all those things are going to be better for traffic therefore.,28,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, all those things are very clear and direct benefits from privatization of public transportation schemes.",29,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,I think that like the one conceivable harm that you can come up with this is for is that like people may be unwilling to do this or it could cost too much money as far as tolls are concerned.,30,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, first and foremost I think that like oftentimes, public transportation, people would be willing to pay a little bit more for public transportation if it was actually effective and actually reliable.",31,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,", the reason why people get annoyed is because public education often acts as a supplement to existing expensive modes of transportation like owning a car or things like that.",32,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But if public transportation could be like a true reliable replacement, it would be something that I think a whole lot of people would actually like appreciate and things like that.",33,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, very proud to oppose.",34,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,We should subsidize public transportation because having good public transportation is incredibly important to a country.,1,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,So first and foremost subsidizing public transportation is really good for the economy.,2,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"It's obviously good for the economy because when you have shorter commute times, greater ease of traveling, and more like movement, you're able to like better interconnect economies.",3,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,So by doing so you're much more able to like efficiently allocate resources.,4,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,You're much more able to allow people to have like more options to work.,5,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"You give people bigger markets that they can sell to, all things like that and these are all things that are good for the economy.",6,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,That's why like a lot of people think that infrastructure is important in the first place because it's good for the economy and it's good for like the people in that economy too.,7,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,It's also going to be good though in that subsidizing public transportation is good for the economy because it also gives people more disposable incomes because in a lot of parts of america if you don't have a car you really can't get anywhere.,8,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"Buses are often grossly inadequate and if you're in a city, oftentimes public transportation is overburdened, out of date and not very effective- particularly in places like boston, that's for sure- and this creates a big problem",9,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,because it means that a lot of people are spent end up going to work late,10,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"because, like, the t is running late or it was snowing",11,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,so people couldn't go to work,12,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"because the t was broken, or things like, like, things like that",13,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"So people are more likely to miss work, go to work late, or people may need to spend money on a car because public transportation simply isn't a feasible option for them because it's not expansive enough that it's even convenient for them or accessible for them and this means that people have less disposable income because cars are expensive.",14,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,You have to buy the car or lease the car.,15,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,You have to spend money for gas for the car.,16,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,You have to maintain the car.,17,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,The car's probably gonna break down a lot so you have to do that too.,18,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,You have to get the car check ups.,19,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,Like all kinds of things that are just end up being you have to buy insurance for car too of course.,20,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,There's all kinds of things that make like obviously car ownership is very expensive.,21,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"So when people can be reliant on public transportation, it just adds like more disposable income which is good for the economy because when people have more disposable income they can like invest that income, save that income, or do whatever with that income so that's good.",22,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"Obviously subsidizing public transportation is also good for the environment too because it'll decrease congestion, it'll take cars off the street, so it'll limit the necessity to use things like fossil fuels or things like that.",23,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,It'll limit our need to keep having oil keep our dependence on oil.,24,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,It means that there's gonna be like less air pollution too because cities tend to be like pretty big in pollution.,25,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"So all those kinds of things are gonna be better for the environment and that's obviously incredibly important but finally, subsidizing public transportation is important for the people's quality of life because it's just nice that you don't have to pay for a car to get around anywhere or use it.",26,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"It's nice where you can get to places cheaply, efficiently.",27,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,It's a nice comfort to have and it's like a valuable public service that I think people have.,28,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,Nobody enjoys having to drive everywhere when it's like all of the times more relaxing to just like sit on a subway car or things like that.,29,,
DJ_2162_public-transportation_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, subsidize public transportation.",30,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,We believe that a policy or an idea of the right to self-defense being absolute is absolutely a horrible idea.,1,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,We on opp prefer a world in which one or the of the two obligations is instead impose.,2,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"One: one in which there is a duty to flee or a duty to de-escalate in a situation in which there is a threat or secondarily, a duty to if it is not possible to flee, a duty to not try to kill, a duty to rather try to incapacitate somebody.",3,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So two reasons for this: the fact that this is an absolute defense edict what is would be very prone to abuse and secondarily, that there is an affirmative right to life and due process for people whose lives would be ended by such a practice.",4,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So first let's talk about abuse.,5,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,There's two reasons under this.,6,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,The first of which is that people are incredibly bad.,7,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Reason why it would be abused is that people are incredibly bad at perceiving threats and the reason for this is because fear clouds a rational judgment.,8,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So obviously it would be not great if there is some kind of a threat and people did not need to kill somebody, it's probably not controversial that it would be preferable that people wouldn't take such an action that would kill somebody.",9,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,It would be preferable if they were if they called the authorities or if they tried to flee or if they did something else instead.,10,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"The problem is that when you're not obviously since you're probably just talking about an average person, not anyone trained especially to deal with these kinds of things, a: fear clouds your judgement so you're more likely to be prone to a violent reaction, even if it's not one that is necessary.",11,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So what this does is this results in needless death.,12,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Secondarily, we think that there's a racial undertone that's often going to happen to this, and the reason for this is because oftentimes like especially in a society like america, blackness is often associated with danger or violence, or in some other parts of the world in context, muslims are associated with like violence and conflict as well.",13,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that the problem is that people are more inculcated to believe such norms so people are more likely to perceive threats from these groups.,14,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"This is how you get situations like unarmed black men in america being shot or things like the george zimmerman case where it's a perceived act of self-defense, when in reality it's actually an aggressive action.",15,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that when you have an absolute right to self-defense, especially the way in which it's often practically fulfilled in a legal court system, what it does is it results in very clear egregious abuses like this.",16,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that these such abuses, since they're essentially resulting in either innocent lives being dead or at the very least, needless lives being lost.",17,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,These are certainly more important than the counterfactual.,18,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"but additionally, we also think that even people who are possibly committing crimes or threatening your life, that these people still have a right to life, in the same way that you have a right to life, in that, in order for any kind of punishment to be imposed on them, any kind of like suffering on them, there's a certain process that must be fulfilled.",19,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that this is something that is very important to talk about here because I think that an absolute right to self-defense, in which you can just kill someone if they do something to you, this is very clearly essentially just vigilante justice.",20,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,You just doing what you want in absence of the state.,21,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that there's a big problem here because even if somebody is physically like imminently about to harm you, that does not necessarily make them guilty because guilty is a process, it's a legal process.",22,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,That's how you actually get a just outcome.,23,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"It's a process that is achieved by a a certain set of due processes via the ability for people to plead their case, by the ability for them to have a defense and certain rights being imposed on them.",24,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"And even if that's not true, the punishment that has to be imposed on someone has to be proportionate in order for it to be just.",25,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,You probably wouldn't want to execute somebody if they stole a loaf of bread.,26,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,The problem with this is that an absolute right to self-defense overrides the principle of proportionality as well as the principles of due process and justice.,27,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So any act of self-defense that would be absolute and not therefore, a duty to try to de-escalate or flee, is therefore illegitimate and we should not have such of such a right.",28,,
DJ_2165_self-defense_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So for those reasons, proud to oppose.",29,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not legalize sex selection because sex selections legitimizes the worst kinds of sexism and misogyny in a society, and we also think that by banning sex-selection abortions, you're going to help on the path for more gender equality and empowering women in general.",1,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why sex selection is so problematic.,2,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It's important to recognize that sex-selection abortions almost exclusively target women.,3,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"They target women because they are perceived as being less financially valuable, they're perceived as being less valuable as human beings culturally valuable, they're seen as more of a drag or maybe they're just not wanted.",4,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"These are obviously horrible ideals, ideals that we shouldn't allow to happen.",5,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, what is important to make sure that we focus on this debate is how can we change that?",6,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Now can we just accept that this is the way cultures are, this is the way some realities are, but how can we actually take positive steps toward making it so that people don't actually look at their at women this way?",7,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, the first thing that I think it's important to note is that banning something comes with incredible power.",8,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"When you ban something in society, you are casting the an ultimate moral condemnation on that.",9,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"When you think about the things that we do ban in society, there are things that are generally not very highly looked upon, where we ban things like murder, robbery, theft, all these kinds of things.",10,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"We ban them because they are we ban them because we recognize that these come with a very intrinsic harm to society, harms to other people, and there's something that we cannot tolerate.",11,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We also think that the moral force of the law can also be very much a compelling force,12,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because, even if people aren't necessarily going to change their minds, we also think that people are going to be likely to weigh against the like, the costs, against the benefits of the fact, especially if they're like afraid of the fact that they could get that doctors may not be like willing to perform these procedures",13,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,they may think that it could be unsafe to go to like an alternative source.,14,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,they may be more willing to just have the baby and not worry about a sex selection.,15,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So I think that, therefore, on those two levels, on the fact that you're more likely to change people's minds so you're not going to have to worry about this call in the first place and you're second, going to deter people from doing this, this is a direct way in which you get less sex-selection abortion, which is good for women's empowerment.",16,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But the next thing that I want to talk about is about why this is necessarily okay.,17,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because it is woefully insufficient to just say, "" oh, culture overrides, oh, autonomy overrides "", but these aren't good enough reasons because what we're talking about is systemic sexism that needs to be combatted.",18,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Obviously we wouldn't allow things like female genital mutilation to we shouldn't allow things like female genital mutilation to exist and be accepted.,19,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Those are cultural practices in the same way that the sex-selective abortion or in the same way that preferences for a male child can be a cultural practice.,20,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,That doesn't mean that it's good and that doesn't mean that we should just auto-defer to that and be tolerant of that.,21,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,There are certain practices that are quite bad.,22,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"This is one of those things there need to be boundaries on autonomy, and we put those all the time and this is a fair set of circumstances to do that.",23,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But additionally, I think that culture is also just a particularly dubious reason because it's assumed that people can't change their minds, or that this is just going to be the way things are.",24,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe there's going to be resistance, maybe people are going to get upset about that, but ultimately that's not really the way that social progress works.",25,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Social progress oftentimes requires necessarily contending with this backlash, contending with this anger, in order to achieve a desired outcome, and this case that desired outcome is making sure that women don't have to be worried about that that women don't feel like the only reason that they exist was because of like like a sex-selection abortion or things like that.",26,,
DJ_2166_sex-selection_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, we definitely should keep we should ban sex-selection abortions.",27,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,We should not abolish standardized testing.,1,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So before I get into any of the details about this, I want to be very clear about a clarification of the scope of this debate because recognize that standardized testing does not necessarily mean entirely embracing the way engaging with standardized testing.",2,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Doesn't mean entirely following the status quo.,3,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So this means that we don't necessarily have to have high-stakes testing.,4,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Nor does it mean, in fact, we would like to defend the opposite: that the funding of schools is contingent on their success, and that schools lose funding if they perform poorly.",5,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"If anything, we would argue for the opposite of such a system possibly.",6,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's start with an overview.",7,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"We think that standardized tests are important because they determine a good baseline of information which is important for resource allocation, and that secondarily the way in which such decisions are made, in absence of standardized testing, would ultimately be more biased and more pernicious.",8,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about the like access of information, why it's important to have standardized tests as an source of information.",9,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Because recognize that whether you're talking about something like the SATs and the ACTs in which there is a limited number of spots for college admission, or you're talking about where you should allocate limited federal funds or state funds for education, there's always going to be more limits on the resource compared to the the need and demand for that.",10,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So this is very important because you need to come up with a way to fairly determine where these resources should go.,11,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that this is where standardized testing can play a very important role.,12,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Once if you establish uniform, objective, standardized tests, you're able to see who's performing better, who's performing worse, which areas, which types of students, etcetera.",13,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"This is incredibly important because this lets you have a better idea of who needs more help, who needs more focus, where should more money go, and this is actually very important towards making sure that schools can be more effective in actually dealing with problems.",14,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But, additionally, it's also important to note that the counterfactual can be a whole lot worse.",15,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Because in a world in which there isn't actually standardized testing, what does this world look like?",16,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"You are already going to have assumptions that if, like college, for example, isn't going to look at an SAT score, ACT score, they're probably going to defer to other metrics like engagement in extracurriculars, engagement in some kind of like activities or traveling, or the rigorousness of your courses.",17,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,things like that and all of those things are disproportionately more likely to hurt lower-income people or worse-off people.,18,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,And the reason for that is because they quite simply aren't able to access these things in the same way.,19,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Oftentimes, a lot of these schools are less likely to offer these kinds of things, maybe like they don't have a debate team, or you don't have the money to go to a debate tournament in the high school that can help you get into college, or people are just going to assume that if you go to in inner city public high school it's more likely to not be as rigorous as a private high school in the suburbs, and people are going to then internalize that",20,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,And a standardized test give them the way to get around that.,21,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,It's obviously not a perfect metric but at least it gives you a way to an objective way to prove yourself.,22,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,It gives you an objective way to actually demonstrate your knowledge on certain things.,23,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that this is also important for schools too in absence of that, because I think that in a lot of ways in absence of this, you're not going to exactly know what need is going to look like for schools.",24,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So I think that state or federal government would be more likely to defer to a more egalitarian distribution, which may sound good, but that doesn't necessarily match up with need.",25,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So ultimately, that wouldn't be all that good.",26,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But, additionally, I would finally argue that there's no real harm to standardized testing in a lot of ways, especially if it's not high-stakes and standardized testing is being largely used for information gathering and things like that.",27,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,It's certainly better than the alternatives and it can certainly just be implemented in better ways than it is in the status quo.,28,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should not abolish standardized testing.",29,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"We should abolish standardized testing, because people learn in different ways.",1,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,It is a waste of time and it is a waste of money.,2,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"So, first, why do we think that standardized testing is a problem for different kinds of learners.",3,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,Obviously there are good testers and there are bad testers.,4,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"The problem with this, is that good testers are oftentimes not actually learning really anything from the process of taking these tests themselves, and the test doesn't even provide a whole lot of value to them.",5,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"Just because you're able to memorize a whole bunch of facts, you are able to figure things out on a test, doesn't mean that there's actually any real indication or proof that you've learned anything, or that you're actually prepared to engage with the real world.",6,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"However, on the flip side of this, there's also obviously bad test takers, and just",7,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"because somebody isn't necessarily good at taking a test doesn't mean that they haven't learned skills that can be applied in some way, and it doesn't mean that they're prepared to move on to the next ring or other things like that, and it certainly doesn't mean that these people have any less degree of intelligence than people that are good test takers",8,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, we also think that standardized testing is a waste of time.",9,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"Because recognize that when you have a standardized test, it doesn't allow for the specialization that comes with individual classes that people are taking.",10,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"So for example, when I was growing up in florida, I was required to take the florida comprehensive assessment test or the FCATs.",11,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"And I would have to learn about, and I would, my teachers would be forced to spend weeks teaching to this test, and this would happen regardless of what level of the class you're taking.",12,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"so if you're taking more advanced classes, you could be having to waste weeks on end making sure to reviewing this basic material.",13,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"so that way, these tests are still going to be passable for students.",14,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"And on the flip side, if students are maybe not prepared necessarily to be taking these tests and should be taking other classes for that, this is necessarily a good uses of time as well.",15,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"But, in addition to it not being applicable to skill level, we don't necessarily think that it's controlled very well for content areas either,",16,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"because oftentimes the concepts that are covered on these tests are rather basic concepts, rather broad concepts, concepts that can't necessarily be applied to a whole lot of things and things that are ultimately not all that important to actually learn about or know about anyway",17,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,But the final thing that I want to talk about is about how this is a waste of time.,18,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"And the reason I think sorry, that this is a waste of money.",19,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that it's very important to talk about money and its relation to this, because keep in mind that there's an opportunity cost with education spending, and that every dollar that is spent administering standardized test is money that could actually be spent on making schools better, it's it's money that could be spent on better textbooks, on paying teachers more.",20,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,And this is especially important given that oftentimes education budgets are among the first things that get slashed by governments in times of recessions or hardships.,21,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,So why do we think that standardized tests are a waste of money.,22,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,Because I think that the costs that come with them are oftentimes quite high.,23,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"For example, you need to make sure that you pay for all of the booklets and all the scantrons that get used.",24,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,Oftentimes these things are costly in and of itself since you need millions of them.,25,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"You also need machines to read the tests, and you need also proctors or graders to administer the test and look over tests and grade tests, you have to pay for the hours of those people.",26,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,You have to administer trainings for people so they are prepared to teach how to teach to the test.,27,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"And you also have to provide money to question researchers, question triers, things like that as well.",28,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,"All of those costs can eventually stack up and pile up, and they could be all of that money, each dollar of that money could be used anywhere else.",29,,
DJ_2167_standardized-testing_pro.trs.txt,And it is for all of those reasons that we are incredibly that I'm incredibly proud to propose that we abolish standardized testing.,30,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"Patriotism definitely does more harm than good, for two big reasons: first, because patriotism as an ideology leads to people enacting far more oppressive, and worse off, policies, and secondarily, because patriotism makes it more difficult to even critique the validity, or benefits, or cost of these policies itself.",1,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,So let's break all that down.,2,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"First, let's talk about the policies themselves, and why I think that patriotism fosters a lot of that policies.",3,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,The reason why it does this is because patriotism creates almost an idea of in group supremacy.,4,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"it creates, like this, pathological support for your own nation, for your own government.",5,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"it puts the values that you try like uniquely possess on a pedestal and it necessarily oftentimes portrays this in contrast to other cultures or other nations or other values, and it also necessarily creates a system where there's an us versus them dichotomy.",6,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think that this is really important, because what it does is it creates things like more animosity towards like say, free trade, or more animosity towards immigration policy, or more of a willingness to declare war.",7,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,All of these things are obviously very bad for different reasons.,8,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"But I also think that it also has, in addition to those more like international impacts, like the way in which you can harm other people, by discriminating against like hispanics because of immigration, or things like that.",9,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"It also has a problematic domestic nature as well, and I think that the reason for that is because patriotism results in a skew of spending priorities.",10,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"What it does is, instead of seeing spending on, maybe, things like healthcare being prioritized, you're more likely to see,",11,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"because of a patriotic ideology, more likely to see government money going towards things like the military or war, or like crime prevention or any of the other kinds of things that are more traditionally associated with patriotism or with, like, like, american ideology, and that's very important",12,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,because this hurts a lot of people,13,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,it hurts a lot of people when we're willing to spend more money on war than on things like healthcare or education.,14,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"But the second area of debate I want to discuss is that, patriotism makes it harder to critique policy itself, and it makes it harder to critique policy, because, what it lets you do is it lets you dismiss the complaints that people bring up about your policies as simply anti american.",15,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"What it does, is it creates a way for you to use scare tactics, or anti american sentiment, in order to just eliminate dissent.",16,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"So, what would be like an example of this illustrate the principle of this?",17,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"You could be saying that like, if you're like anti war, because you think the war is unjust, or because like you're hurting other people, or things like that, it's very easy for someone to say like: you're soft on war, you're soft on defense, you're soft on this or that, or even more perniciously: do you want the russians to get an advantage?",18,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,Do you want mexico to get an advantage?,19,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"Or china or whatever x country is, that's like very very bad, because what it does is it diminishes the value of the concerns on face.",20,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,It doesn't let you actually discuss: you know what?,21,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"Maybe we shouldn't be doing this thing, this money could be better spent elsewhere, things like that.",22,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"It diminishes the actual value of the discussion in the discourse, and essentially makes it like this like impossible discussion, about who's more american, who's better in line with these arbitrary values.",23,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think that that's also like very very bad.",24,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"And, that means they are less likely going to actually get the better policies being enacted.",25,,
DJ_2183_patriotism_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, because patriotism leads to worse policies, and because patriotism means you're going to be less likely to try to critique those policies, very proud to propose that, it does more harm than good.",26,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,We should legalize public nudity for a few big reasons.,1,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"first, because I think that banning public nudity is inherently immoral, because it restricts the way in which people are able to express themselves with their body in a way in which doesn't really actually affect other people.",2,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"and, secondarily, because I think that it fosters a culture of body shaming which leads to a lot of bad norms with regards to, like, mental health, but also stigma as far like safety for the body, things like that.",3,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about the immoral nature.",4,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"I think that generally, if you want to live in a liberal society that is, accepting of individual lifestyles, the ideal that we should focus on is, as long as it doesn't actually hurt other people and as long as if there is some kind of perceived harm to other people, that harm is actually legitimate, then you should defer to allowing people to express themselves in the individual ways in which they choose",5,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"And that's important, because individual ways in which people express themselves are like a very like inseparable part of their identity.",6,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,It's a very important part of like well being and identity.,7,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"So, these things are very important.",8,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"So, now let's talk about why there's nothing wrong with public nudity, and about why any perceived harm for this are just an illusion.",9,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"Because, recognize that, this is in many ways a distinctly western, the like the idea of banning public nudity, is distinctly western concept, and at that, not only a western concept, but a very religiously rooted in like, judeo, christian, islamic values.",10,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,What do I mean by this?,11,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"If you go to like some places in africa, you're going to see that it's very common that, people dress with little to no clothing, and that there's a lot of like body painting that exists, and like other kinds of body art, and things like that, and that, this is the way in which people express themselves, as opposed to just like wearing clothing and covering up.",12,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think it's important to recognize that, all of this is contextualized based on the culture that you live, and the culture that you grew up in.",13,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"Most people in western society, from the day that they were born, had clothes put on them, and were told every day: you need to wear clothes, you can't just go outside naked, you can't put your body out this way.",14,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"And over time, obviously this becomes a very powerful part of your identity, it becomes like a very powerful notion of shame, but, that doesn't actually mean that it's valid, and it doesn't mean that it's correct.",15,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"So, if people want to not wear clothing, they should have the right to do that.",16,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"The fact that it may offend somebody, that you're not wearing clothing, shouldn't actually matter.",17,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"It doesn't actually hurt you, it only hurts you in like a perceptual sense, because you grew up with a certain expectation or lifestyles.",18,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"But, that's no different than like someone being gay, and having a like a gay wedding hurts you.",19,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"It hurts you in like the ethereal sense, because it goes up against the values that you grew up with, but it doesn't actually lead to any like harm to you in and of itself.",20,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"So, that's why I think it's like a very very important, on like a principal level, to make sure that you allow people to go into the public in the nude, if they want to, and that this is actually very problematic notions.",21,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"But, I also want to talk about body shaming and stigmas, because I think that that's important too.",22,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"So recognize that, when you're brought up, from the day that you're born, in a culture that emphasizes a need to cover up your body, a couple of things happen.",23,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"First and foremost, you're going to there's going to be a lot more stigma with issues related to the body and your sexuality.",24,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"You're going to be much less likely to have sexual education, you're going to be much more likely to do like less safe things to your body, because there's like a social pressure and stigma against having open discussion about the body, and against open discussion with relation to sexuality, because like, that's the root of not wanting public nudity.",25,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,It's like a fear of sexuality of humanity.,26,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"So all of these things do lead to like more of a prevalence of unsafe sex, more of a prevalence of unsafe pregnancies or STI, all these things.",27,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"I also think that, secondarily though, there's problematic mental health issues, that are associated with this too.",28,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"And that's because, from the day that you're born, you're constantly questioning your body, constantly told to, like, shame your body, to cover up your body, which is, in a lot of ways, unhealthy.",29,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"It's not something that's natural, and it's not something that we should be doing.",30,,
DJ_2184_nudity_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, very proud to legalize public nudity.",31,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"ADHD management brings more good than harm because at the end of the day it leads to the recognition of a real issue that people have, and it fosters a sense of need and creates solutions to these problems, and at the end of the day there's no real harm that's associated with attempts for ADHD management.",1,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"So even if the good isn't all that present, since there's very minimal harm, it's something that you should just keep doing.",2,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about ADHD and why I think that it's a real issue, that it's important for us to talk about.",3,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"Because it's not just some coincidence or some kind of like aberration that we've seen millions of millions of people in america being diagnosed with ADHD, and I think that there is to a large extent some biological reasons that have been like documented and are reasons why people have ADHD.",4,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,But it additionally can be the result of the way in which people in a new generation grow up.,5,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"When you grow up with a lot of technology and things like that, a lot of different entertainment options, and just in like day to day lives based on the way a lot of young people grow up nowadays, there's much more of an emphasis on ability to multitask, much more of an emphasis on keeping your attention divided on various things in a technologically advanced world.",6,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think that what this ultimately does is it does mean that it's for a lot of people legitimately more difficult to focus, that they just truly struggle on focus and that while they may be much better off focusing on multiple things at once, their skills aren't on more precise focus, on an individual task for a longer amount of time.",7,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"So this is a very real problem that we need to combat because this ultimately does hurt people for like tests, college and education, but also for jobs and inability to focus on things.",8,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,These are real problems that people have when they're not able to focus.,9,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,So it's definitely something that you want to fix.,10,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,And luckily we do have solutions that are like at least somewhat effective and using them oftentimes.,11,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"First of all, you can have medications.",12,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"These medications, oftentimes you don't even need to give someone with ADHD more than a small dosage of something like adderall a ritalin in order to actually start to see some of the effects of it.",13,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,In order to start to see people able to get more focused.,14,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"And at such small doses, even though they have a good affect on people, this isn't really going to bring a whole lot of possibility for harm or dependence or any of these other kinds of problems.",15,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"But even on the more extreme ends, these are ultimately rather like low risk drugs as long as you use them in the way that a doctor prescribes which is the same risk as any other drug.",16,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that it's therefore not all that bad that people are taking these drugs, that there's no real significant harms associated with them but the benefits are documented quite well.",17,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,Additionally I also think that behavioral changes and trying to make some more like lifestyle lifestyle changes as a part of ADHD management can also just be more positive.,18,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"If you're trying to like help you structure a lifestyle better in a way that's more conducive to focus, I don't see how you can say this actually is bringing harm to someone's life.",19,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"You're trying to help people individually, help their lives so they're better able to focus better in a more structured setting.",20,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,These are just clearly good things.,21,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,I don't know why you would say that they bring harm.,22,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,And that's the final thing I want to talk about.,23,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,About that I don't really think that any of these procedures have real harm.,24,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"I think that where the real harm lies is in not recognizing ADHD as an actual disease, as an actual impairment.",25,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,"it's something that we need to do something to combat, and I think that management certainly brings a lot of good and that there's no real cost a lot of these things, except willingness to embrace the management or the techniques themselves, which I think are ultimately going to make people's lives better.",26,,
DJ_2186_adhd_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons very proud to propose.,27,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,Astrology brings more harm than good for a pretty basic reason.,1,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,It encourages stupidity and simplicity with regards to important questions in life.,2,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,But there are also four main areas of reasoning that I'm going to present to you today as for why astrology does more harm than good.,3,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"First, it it encourages a belief in the false.",4,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"This is incredibly bad because what it ultimately does is it creates a a cultural falling almost, around a legitimization of stupidity.",5,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"And the reason for it is because it's obviously accepted that it's entirely junk science and that there is no actual factual nature at all to astrology, so the fact that people buy into it is only just encouraging buying into something that is false.",6,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"Now this is quite bad because if people are willing to accept false things as facts in other areas of life, it essentially undermines the process it it undermines their process of fact gathering altogether.",7,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"And the reason for this is because if you're not willing to accept facts on certain other things, there's no real guarantee that you'd be willing to listen to facts on more important things than astrology.",8,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"Things like global warming, or the like or fake news that has been more prevalent during the most recent election cycle in america.",9,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"This is incredibly important because it's the same reasoning facilities at hand, and if you accept fakes fake things in that regard then you are in big trouble.",10,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,But the additional thing that I want to talk about is about external sources of control and empowerment.,11,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that this is incredibly important, because I think that by investing in astrology, you're essentially trying to lift blame off of yourself for things that you could have done in your life or the like.",12,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"And I think this is incredibly bad, because when you attribute events in your life to just dumb luck, it results in less empowerment for yourself.",13,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"I think in a world at which astrology doesn't exist, these people are now going to think that things that are happening to them are happening because of their own individual actions or personality or behavior, and I imagine that's just going to make people feel a whole lot better about themselves which is probably good.",14,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,The next problem with astrology is that it's essentially an extortion of the uninformed oftentimes.,15,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"When you look at the people who profit off of astrology or astrologists, these people are essentially no better than a common con artist.",16,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that it's incredibly unfair that people oftentimes, maybe with a lack of information or a lack of education, are misled into believing these kinds of things.",17,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"And while even if these people made that choice, the the harm of listening to these people and spending their money on that is still a harm nothing the less, and there's a harm of astrology for sure.",18,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"But the final problem is with that even if the harms of astrology aren't particularly all that powerful, these harms when looked at in comparison to the good, are certainly going to be a whole lot better.",19,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,And this is true for two reasons.,20,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"First and foremost because astrology is just false, there's no actual basis behind it, there's no benefits behind it, it doesn't actually help with anything in tangible world and a factual sense.",21,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"But as far as perspectives are concerned, it doesn't help a whole lot either, because it's only going to lead to you, if you buy into this, being more likely to be mocked by society.",22,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,People are going you're gonna have less critical inputs and things like that.,23,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,So I don't actually think that it's even going to make be able to make you feel good because you probably get condemned for all of these kinds of things.,24,,
DJ_2187_astrology_pro.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, astrology does more harm than good.",25,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,We should ban fast food because fast food is really horrible for people's health.,1,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,And this is honestly has really dire national consequences.,2,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"When you talk about rising obesity and deteriorating health in places like america, but really across the world, one of the biggest causes for this is the proliferation of fast food as the regular and most common food that people are eating.",3,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,Obviously fast food is horribly unhealthy.,4,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"It has a great deal of like of cholesterol, of it's like highly caloric and has a whole lot of fat in it, it's usually made with foods that are it's often made a lot of artificial ingredients, a lot of artificial preservatives, and there's all kinds of problematic chemicals in addition the food being unhealthy in itself just because of its like nutritional content.",5,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,So fast food is really horrible for you.,6,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"And it's one of the biggest reasons why we have such high obesity rates in america and why a whole lot of people have diabetes, why a lot of people have like heart problems, one of the like largest causes of death amongst people, amongst adults.",7,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,", really the rise of fast food, and the unhealthy eating habits that people get from them, have horrible health consequences.",8,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"It lowers like how it lowers your life span, there is like a whole slew of consequences that are associated with this.",9,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"And this is of national importance, because when our health is worse and when healthcare spending has to be higher to compensate, when people are dying, and they can't really work as long, when people just aren't living as long, there's a basic like moral question there.",10,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,There's all kinds of reasons why fast food just does a whole lot of harm and we should get rid of it.,11,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, fast food isn't even really a choice.",12,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,Because the existence of a fast food as an option necessarily prices out and kicks out healthier options.,13,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"And the reason for this is because first, fast food is just a whole lot cheaper than healthier foods like like vegetables or a whole foods, fresh foods, things like that.",14,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"So it's more likely that, especially in poor communities where you oftentimes have food deserts, you're more likely going to see healthy options getting priced out.",15,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,So generally fast food can be the only thing that's available.,16,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"But beyond that there's also not really a focus on like pre-prepared healthy meals or like healthy and faster meals, and since you are oftentimes over worked nowadays, fast food seems to be a really good option to get quick food for cheap.",17,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,And that's a really big problem because it's really a problem with the way like our economy is focused based on providing less healthy fast food to people as opposed to helping people get access to quality ingredients and healthier food.,18,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,And that's really bad for people's health obviously.,19,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,But finally I also think that there is like a really like there's a problem with fast food from like a cultural perspective.,20,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,From like a communal perspective.,21,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"Because I think that one of the biggest ways in which you bond with people, whether it's like family members or friends, one of the biggest ways that you can bond with somebody is over home cooked meals and wholesome meals.",22,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,And these meals are getting replaced by just fast food.,23,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"Well, rather than you're eating to like enjoy the experience, to enjoy the meal, you're merely eating to like shove some like tasty high caloric foods down your throat, to give you some energy and some like instant jolt of flavor.",24,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,And that's really not a really good way to really enjoy food.,25,,
DJ_2221_ban-fastfood_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should ban fast food.",26,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,Single-sex schools bring more harm than good because they're an incredibly valuable resource for empowering women.,1,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"They empower women, firstly, by creating academic role models, symbolic role models and just generally being icons of the achievements of women.",2,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"And secondarily, they also work more directly in empowering women in society and in their classrooms.",3,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"So, before we get into those arguments, let's talk about how we actually look at this context thing.",4,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,Obviously we're going to defend that single-sex schools bring more good than harm.,5,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"However, this does not necessarily mean that this should be exclusively one system or the other.",6,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,We think that it's important to have a hybrid of both systems and that individual women should choose to go to have the ability to choose to go to single-sex schools if they feel that that is a a better fit for them.,7,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"So, first let's talk about symbols and role models.",8,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"It's obvious that oftentimes when you look at a single-sex school, schools like wellesley or smith or mount holyoke, you look at schools that produce powerful female role models.",9,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"For example, hillary clinton was is an alumni of of wellesley.",10,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"And this is very important because when you have a powerful female academic, powerful female businesspeople, lawyers, politicians, that are able to thrive as a result of these environments they came from, this is very important for inspiring and encouraging women to actually get involved in certain things.",11,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"Because oftentimes women are told by society that certain occupations are not necessarily for them, that they should be pushed away from certain things, whether it's like stem research or or politics or things like that.",12,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,It's very important to make sure you have female role models so that women feel more comfortable and empowered so they can go into these fields.,13,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, it's also important that you look at what these school what single-sex schools produce us as academic work.",14,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"Because when you look at feminism as an ideology, a whole lot of the contributions to the field- scholarly contributions to the field and also practical contributions to the field, such as like organizing people, who are involved in, organizing people who are involved in like fundraising or operations or outreach, things like that- a lot of these people oftentimes come from single-sex schools and a lot of work for advancing feminism comes out of single-sex schools",15,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,So it's very important to make sure that we're that we are empowering this progress to continue because feminism is quite an important thing that we need to make sure that we keep defending.,16,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"This is also additionally important this entire symbolic context, because symbols are incredibly important in society.",17,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"When you think about the confederate flag in the united states, for example.",18,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,As a symbol it doesn't harm any it doesn't exactly cause like physical harm to people.,19,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,But as a symbol it's important because it's a representation of the continued oppression of african americans in society.,20,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"This is in many ways similar for single-sex schools because while even if we're not able to show that they achieve like a practical or tangible support, although I already think that we have done so, they're immensely important for the symbolic aspects of the way in which they empower women.",21,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"So, next, let's talk about some of the ways in which single-sex schools directly empower women.",22,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"There is a concept that's oftentimes called the confidence gap, in which women feel less confident or comfortable expressing a lot of their opinions, particularly when they're in the presence of men who are often times much more comfortable expressing their opinions.",23,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"So in order to combat this, single-sex schools can oftentimes be a very good solution to this problem.",24,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"Because in single-sex classrooms, when you have all women, you're going to have women that are going to be feeling more comfortable contributing in class, contributing work, and all of those kinds of things are gonna be good.",25,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, it's also important to recognize that single-sex classrooms and schools are more likely to be less biased against women,",26,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"because when you look at women's academic achievements and performance in comparison to women- especially when it can come to like presentations or speaking or competitive spots on a team or things like that- oftentimes women are more likely to get their contributions, are more likely to get undervalued, and this is something that's less likely to happen when they come from a single-sex school",27,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"And all of this in turn makes it more likely that women will be high-achieving and therefore more likely to achieve later in life, which ultimately corrects a lot of systemic imbalance in society.",28,,
DJ_2222_single-sex-schools_pro.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, single-sex schools do more harm than good.",29,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"Embryonic stem cell research brings more good than harm, for two big reasons: first, because the good that it brings is quite massive, and far outweighs in importance any possible harms, and secondarily, even if the good is only of marginal importance, the harms, both practical and ethical, I believe are rather minimal, and therefore it's still bringing more good than harm.",1,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about the first one of those things, about why embryonic stem cell research does bring so much good.",2,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,There's a few obvious important things that stem cell research does.,3,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"I believe there's two big groups of this: first, it as it, can help you come up with more advanced medical technologies, to prevent people from dying, and second of those things is that, it can make maybe existing medicines, or existing technologies cheaper and more accessible to more people.",4,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"So, why are these things very important?",5,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"So, on the first one of those things, there's a whole lot of things that, even in even in current times, with modern medicine, we don't have cures for.",6,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"A lot of things like nerve damage, things like things to like the central nervous system, brain damage, or if certain organs become compromised, it becomes very difficult to come up with ways in which you can actually replace these organs or cure these kinds of ailments.",7,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"but stem cell research gives us unique opportunity to combat these problems by being able to program on certain kinds of like new cells, almost like unprogrammed cells.",8,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"You can direct them into new things, so like, you can almost you can create new kinds of nerve cells, you can create parts of like new organs, things like that.",9,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"You can do all kinds of cool things with stem cells that, make it so that you can cure a lot of problems that we currently have, and that's great.",10,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"But, the second thing is as far as cheapness and access, because even if a lot of these things exist in the status quo, stem cells give us superior alternatives.",11,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"So, for example, if you need to like get a kidney transplant, or something like that, right now you have to wait for like a donor match , and all these things can take a long time, or it cost a lot of money to do so.",12,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"If you want to or like a blood donation, things like that.",13,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"These things are oftentimes up to chance, or your social status.",14,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"But with stem cells, a lot of these barriers are more likely to come down",15,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"because, rather than having to wait for a perfect match or something like that, you can have doctors that are going to be able to create the match for you by using your- by using like your own DNA, essentially, and things like that, and then they can redirect the stem cells as replacements and things like that",16,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"So, that can definitely cut down waiting times, and cut down cost, which definitely is going to save people's lives.",17,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"So, that's those are the reasons why stem cell does a whole lot of good for people.",18,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"Basically, it just saves lives in new and more innovative ways, and at cheaper costs, things that are undeniably good.",19,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"But I also think that, there's no real harm from stem cells, on either an ethical or practical level.",20,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"So, first on the practical level, there hasn't really been any substantial research that shows that there are any actual real side effects, or problems with stem cells, namely because, the goal is that they're just going to operate like any other cell in your body.",21,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"And, while there could be some limited problems associated with, the science actually looks quite optimistic on the efficacy of stem cell like treatments on the problems.",22,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"Now, as far as the ethical implications are concerned, there is a big misconception here, and it's that you're just like aborting fetuses, and things like that, specifically for stem cell research.",23,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"Oftentimes, these are already aborted fetuses, which is something that people have a right to do, legally you can get an abortion.",24,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"So basically, it's just a matter of are these things going to go to waste, or should you have the option to conduct medical research on them.",25,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"In a lot of ways, this is the same way as like, allowing people to volunteer as organ donors, or allowing people to volunteer upon death, upon their death, of like donating body parts to science, and things like that.",26,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"These are perfectly simple things that we let people do, because they serve a public good, and because they're really not all that infringing on people's rights, or liberties in any capacity.",27,,
DJ_2223_stem-cell_pro.trs.txt,"So, for all of those reasons, very proud to propose this motion.",28,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"Water fluoridation brings more harm than good because it's helpful for public health, even if there are other alternatives that could possibly use, it's helpful for public health, and it doesn't come with any harms.",1,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,The only harm is cost and the reasonable we're gonna argue don't think that's a good enough reason.,2,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about health.,3,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,Obviously fluoride is very important.,4,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"Fluoride can help fight cavities, it can ensure stronger tooth health, things that are very important.",5,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"So, why is why are why is water fluoridation, why is public water fluoridation a necessary tool to make sure that you can uphold public health?",6,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"Because when you talk about people who are going to be more dependent on water fluoridation for their health, you're talking about poor people, poor people in society who are more dependent on public drinking water",7,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"because they're not going to buy their bougie five dollar fiji water bottle or something like that, or they also may be less able to afford more, like newer toothpaste bottles that like a ten dollar colgate pro-health five-time cavity fighting toothpaste that you like to buy, or things like that",8,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"So, if you're gonna be less able, they're also oftentimes is less able to get dentist less able to afford dentist appointments, dentist disappointments may not always be fully covered under health insurance, deductibles could be too much, things like that.",9,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"So, water fluoridation is a good either supplement for people who already have access to these kinds of resources because it doesn't hurt that, but for people who don't have access to other alternate sources, this could be very important.",10,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,This can make sure that they're healthier.,11,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"This can be cost-saving for them, this could mean that they are better able to do like a whole lot of other things, so that I think is good.",12,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,This is incredibly important to realize when you look at this in conjunction with the potential cost of water fluoridation because there's no health harms of water fluoridation.,13,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,Water fluoridation doesn't actually have any kind of adverse impact on anyone health healthwise.,14,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,So the only thing that we have to look at is the actual money involved.,15,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"So, first and foremost, water fluoridation isn't all that expensive, doesn't cost all that money, it's fairly cheap.",16,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think that, alone, this is worth it on moral grounds because you're helping out people who wouldn't otherwise be able to have access to these kinds of things, and this is a rather important thing.",17,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,Teeth health tooth health is rather important to people.,18,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, I also think that the health cost is going to outweigh anyway, and the reason that this is true is because a lot of the people who will if if more people start to get cavities or more people start to see tooth decay, this is not something that is going to happen for free.",19,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,People are going to have to this is going to have to get paid for somehow.,20,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,And the way in which it is going to get paid for is likely more and further straining on public healthcare systems.,21,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"They're going to be having they're going to be having just like because the public is going to have to pay for it on like some kind of like public healthcare plans most likely, things like medicaid and the like.",22,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"Or so this is a problem because what this ultimately contributes to is a problem where it would have cost less money to deal with the problem preemptively, and it also would have helped more people if the problem was dealt with preemptively.",23,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"So, you're not actually saving all that much anyway.",24,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,You're just what this would be is a long-term investment economically.,25,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,So that I think is quite good.,26,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"So, since this is important for tooth health for people broadly, it's also specifically important for tooth health for poor people because it comes with no adverse health harms and because it's quite cheap and, even if it wasn't all that cheap, which it is, the long-term health consequences outweigh this anyway.",27,,
DJ_2381_fluoridation_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, water fluoridation brings more good than harm.",28,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not increase the fuel task because tax because doing so would be economically disastrous and especially harmful to poor people in society and also, because doing so will create essentially a revenue trap in which people will governments, rather, will continue to be reliant on oil as a source of income, essentially.",1,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, first, why is increasing a fuel tax going to be incredibly harmful for the economy?",2,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, first and foremost, it obviously is going to make the cost of travel much higher and this will have incredibly wide-ranging impacts because this will literally make everything more expensive.",3,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Everything is going to be harder to transport to various places, it's going to be harder to produce and get to consumers, so this means that it's going to be more expensive to buy everything.",4,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"This means that consumption is going to go down, necessarily in rather widespread ways.",5,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, this means that you're also you're going to necessarily not have as much, like, profits for businesses and you're not going to have as much ability of, like, people actually consuming, so this is one of the biggest recipes for a recession.",6,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"But in addition to consumption being lessened, this is also going to make it a whole lot more difficult for people to actually people are going to have to spend more money on transportation which means that they're also going to have less alternative sources of revenue to spend.",7,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, in addition to things just costing more, they're also going to have less money to spend on those things,",8,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"because they have to spend more money on the increased costs of fuel, and the reason for this is",9,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"because, in absence of oftentimes good public transportation options in america, things that even with an increased fuel task tax, are probably not going to be very likely to exist, you're essentially just forcing people to pay more money without actually getting anything else in return",10,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So you're just going to force more people- some people who are oftentimes poor and not, and oftentimes having a car and paying for it, its gas, are expensive enough as it is.",11,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"they're gonna be forcing these people to spend even more money on their transportation, which means that they're going to have less money to spend on other things, whether those things be things to increase their social mobility, like education, or more just luxury goods and other items that could be helpful for the economy when they're spent.",12,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, this is quite bad.",13,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"But the final way in which this is going to be harmful for poor people uniquely- is that this is a directly regressive tax, in that if you're- if you have less money having to pay for your fuel needs, you're now going to have to pay a greater percentage of your- of the actual total money you produce on fuel.",14,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"this is going to have a much greater impact on you than someone who is much wealthier, because that person is much more able to afford the comparative increase in money that is going to be spent on feuls.",15,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, that's going to be very good, so, that's not gonna be very good as well.",16,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"But, in addition to how this is going to be bad for the economy because it's going to be bad for consumption, it's going to make everything more expensive and it's also going to hurt poor people, I also think that this is going to be bad in the long run for fiscal responsibility for governments.",17,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,And why is this true?,18,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Because I think that now, when you create a a higher gas tax, this means that governments are now going to get a more of their operating costs are going more of their, like, operating costs are going to be funded from gas.",19,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, this means that while there's going to be like the like overt facade that the reason why the fuel tax is being raised is because they want to decrease reliance on fuel, in a lot of ways this is actually not true and the reason this isn't true is because the government necessarily makes money off the fact that people are going to keep using fuel.",20,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"What this essentially creates is- especially since there's not a whole lot of political or feasible momentum behind that many widespread alternatives to gasoline at this time- what this essentially creates a a climate of tacit acceptance of fuel consumption, because fuel consumption means that the government has more money to spend money on things, and obviously that's something that is good.",21,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"the government should have money to do things,",22,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"but the argument we're making is that we don't want it to come from a source like fuel,",23,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"because when the government is making money in that way, they're going to be less likely to do things like instill regulations on the industry or encourage alternative sources of development,",24,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"because all of those alternates are going to ultimately create a, a compounding economic cost of transition, a compounding economic cost that's going to come as a result of having less money",25,,
DJ_2401_fuel-tax_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, for those reasons, you shouldn't increase the fuel task tax.",26,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,We should abandon the insanity plea.,1,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"First, because it's ultimately rather unnecessary in contemporary legal systems and secondarily, because the insanity plea is inherently speculative.",2,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,So first why is the insanity plea quite unnecessary?,3,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,In the status quo if somebody has a mental illness in order to actually convict them of a crime there's generally two criteria that have to be meet.,4,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"First, that person with a mental illness has to be seen as competent for trial and then second, that person with a mental illness you have to like prove that they weren't insane the time the crime.",5,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,So I want to talk about the first element of that because I think that the purpose of the insanity plea is by and large to ensure that people with mental disabilities are not held like to the same degree of of culpability for the crimes that they commit because they have minimal control over their actions as a result of their illness.,6,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,But it's important to note that this is oftentimes interwoven with competency in general.,7,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,So if you're unfit to stand trial then you're ultimately going to see a rather similar result to a successful insanity plea.,8,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"If someone is unfit for trial, they're probably going to be in some kind of institution forced commitment to an institution designed for mental health and the way in which the fitness for trial criteria is met is basically is this person mentally secure enough that they can understand the charges that are being given against them.",9,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"Are they able to adequately participate in their own defense, things like- and if they're not able to do so, if they don't have the mental capacity to do so, then they're already not fit for trial and you're already going to have other alternate measures take place.",10,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"that is both going to ensure that they can get the treatment that they need and insure that they're not going to be a danger to society,",11,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"but at the same time, it also means that the trial part of itself is unnecessary, and that's important",12,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"because in a lot of ways it's a similar correction,",13,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"but it saves the like,",14,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,but it saves the necessity of putting someone with a mental illness through the entire trial process,15,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"and it also saves the state a lot of money too, because prosecutions can be quite, quite expensive, especially on cases with mental health where you have to call in a whole lot of professional health experts.",16,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,So you do save a lot of money on these things and I think that's something that's very important.,17,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"A thing to keep in mind is that if somebody is competent to stand trial, then you become.",18,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"then you have a problem, because if somebody is competent to stand trial, then maybe their mental illness is something that is minor enough or treatable enough that you should put the expectation on them to obey the law.",19,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"because, while obviously some people have, like, different degrees of mental stability, it's important to note that there's always a duty to obey the law and a duty to ensure compliance with the law, and that just because it may be more difficult for some people than other people because of mental illness does not mean that you necessarily get a pass for the law.",20,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,So I think that only in the more extreme circumstances should you actually do this.,21,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"but the next thing that I want to talk about is about the inherently speculative nature of this,",22,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"because when we're talking about the insanity plea, by and large most, most jurisdictions- at least in america,",23,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"because this rule originated in, like europe,",24,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,so most commonwealth areas are going to use this rule- is whether you are able to recognize the distinction between what was right and wrong,25,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,more leads like the m'naghten rule.,26,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,Can you tell the difference between right and wrong?,27,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,If you can't tell the difference between right and wrong then you're seen as mentally unfit and therefore you have a successful insanity plea.,28,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"But the problem with this is that if you have a chronic mental illness, then you're probably already fit.",29,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,"but if you're trying to make an argument about something like, say, maybe temporary insanity or lower level insanity, these are things are oftentimes very difficult to prove because it's rather difficult to obtain evidence of a singular point of what's going on in someone's head in a singular point in time, because you can't look into somebody's head.",30,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,So it's difficult to actually get evidence on these things so it becomes highly speculative and a very problematic way to actually enact justice.,31,,
DJ_2442_insanity-plea_pro.trs.txt,So for all of those reasons we should abandon the insanity plea.,32,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,Organ donation should be mandatory because it saves lives.,1,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,Let's start by talking about what we're going to do as far as the actual enforcement of mandatory organ donation.,2,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"First, as far as live organ donation is concerned, you're going to be automatically enrolled in it as soon as you try to get a driver's license or register to vote or any other kind of service like that.",3,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"You're automatically going to be registered in a live in an organ donation and if you refuse to do so, once a doctor tries to call you about an organ donation, then you can be prosecuted under that, criminally.",4,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"And secondarily, everyone upon death is going to be - if they want their will to be enforced to any capacity - it's gonna to be required that you're going to be a organ donor upon death.",5,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,So now let's talk about why such requirements is necessary.,6,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"First and foremost, in the status quo, organ donation system has failed and the reason that it's failed is the way in which it has failed is obvious.",7,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"There's far too people in the system and it's incredibly difficult to find actual matches in order to get organ donations done, especially in emergency circumstances.",8,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"The reason for it is simple: people are stupid and people think that when they give up one of their two kidneys, or something else like that, they're going to maybe possibly harm themselves, or people are lazy and they don't feel like it's worth the effort to do all these kinds of things.",9,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,Now the problem is is that these things don't aren't particularly important when you compare them to the actual emergencies that can be solved.,10,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"So, how do we think that we're actually going to be able to solve these things?",11,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"First and foremost, when you require everyone to be as part of the system, you're just going to have more people in the system.",12,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"This is incredibly important because there's a whole lot of people in various locations that get sick, and one of the problems that we see is that, even if a match does exist, there could be limited supplies of a certain kind of match or a certain kind of blood type, so you may not be able to access it right away.",13,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"a match may be far away, so there may be difficulties and transporting things, and all of that can lead to more complications and risk.",14,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,So all of those are always are problems that are going to be solved.,15,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,So basic point of this is that you're going to save lives and that the system is going to be better.,16,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"So, now that we've talked about that and about how this is obviously going to be better let's talk about possible ethical implications.",17,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"I think as far as ethical implications are concerned, it's very clearly going to be positive.",18,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,And there's a few reasons for this: first and foremost because you're going to save lives.,19,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,So I don't think that any harm actually realistically exists for most forms of organ donation.,20,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,You have two kidneys and if you give one up you're probably not going to have many problems.,21,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"if you're dead, then you're certainly not going to have any kind of horrible problems and I think that you can like any kind of argument you could possibly make - religious rights or whatever - even if you wanna take the strongest one, which is probably religious rights.",22,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"quite simply, lives are more important.",23,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,We don't let people practice religion in any kind of way.,24,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"if it means that more people are going to die, and if you, practicing your religion in a certain way makes it more likely that someone's gonna die because they're not gonna be able to get an organ donation in emergency, then the state has every right to say this is what's best for the people and that what this is what's best for society overall.",25,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,But additionally I think that harms are quite rare anyway and they're very much unlikely.,26,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"I think that in most cases this can be done safe, in fact it's oftentimes much safer under this system because it's going to be done in a much like broader sense and there's going to be less need to worry about things like travel between like the coordinations and things like that.",27,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"And finally, even in the most unlikely circumstances where there is some kind of harm, most likely these harms are gonna be minor like maybe a doctor boxes an organ donation or something like that.",28,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,Then there's other ways that you can correct for this in these very select few cases.,29,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,"Maybe you can have a tort lawsuit, you can sue someone for damages, any , pretty much every country in the world has provisions like this in the status quo, you don't have to you don't have to, you can just you don't have to change the entire system for these few isolated cases.",30,,
DJ_2449_organ-donation_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons organ donation should be mandatory.,31,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Abolishing needle exchange programs is an absolutely horrible idea, it's not going to deter people from doing drugs like heroin, it's not going to cure addiction, it's not gonna deter anyone, all it's going to do is spread diseases more rapidly, which is bad, and be incredibly unsafe for incredibly vulnerable people, which is immoral and awful.",1,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, that's why we should keep needle exchange programs.",2,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"First, why do I think that abolishing needle exchange programs solves absolutely nothing.",3,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, there is no tangible good that can come out of it.",4,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And the reason for this is like the idea of it is like, when you give drug addicts needles to use, they're gonna use those things to do drugs.",5,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So like by magic if you don't give them the needles, then they're not going to do drugs or they're gonna to do it less or something like that, which is like absolutely ridiculous.",6,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"First and foremost on like like a logical level, and second on a like emotional understanding and like our scientific understanding even.",7,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So like, first on a logical understanding like, if people are, it's already like drugs like heroin which are predominantly what get used for these things, like, these drugs are already illegal in the status quo they're already somewhat difficult to access in the status quo, you already have to like do a lot to get these kinds of things and the like.",8,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"If you're willing to like go out of your way, so like consistently acquire heroin and use heroin when you probably know that it's not all that safe or useful.",9,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"I don't think that the absence of a clean needle is going to curtail you, especially given that there's going to clearly be a whole lot of people who, since they're addicted to drugs, are just going to rely on using old needles, using needles that they find lying around, using someone else's needle, all things that are gonna be like much, much more dangerous.",10,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,", I also think that this is going to like lead, like it leads to, like it's a very naive way to actually look at addiction because people don't, people keep using drugs not because they maybe think that it's like affirmatively good, but because like they feel like they have to because they don't know what they could maybe do without it or things like that.",11,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,I think that the most important thing that we should be doing is emphasizing a willingness of people getting treatment.,12,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So if you wanna make sure that people are more willing to actually get treatment for drug addiction, how about, instead of keep making it more and more difficult, keep shaming them or like by like getting rid of their support services?",13,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,how about you try like bring them in more?,14,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,how about you try to actually help them a whole lot more?,15,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"give them these needles and when they come to get those needles, make sure you're asking them: do you want help?",16,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"make sure that they are aware of resources, that they can have access to all these other kinds of things, and that's like a whole lot better way of actually decreasing stigma associated with drugs.",17,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But, let's talk about like the safety concerns associated with needle exchange programs.",18,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,First for drug users and second for society more broadly.,19,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, like I said, people are still going to do heroin anyway or other kinds of drugs anyway with dirty or less safe needles.",20,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"This does lead to things like HIV and AIDS getting transmitted, it leads to other diseases as well, being more likely to get transmitted.",21,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"That's bad because it means that more people are going to get sick and die, but it also means that like there's more of a general prevalence of these diseases.",22,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like you don't want to have, like higher like even if it's like because, like drug addicts aren't just like there's a warded off segment of the population, like they have sex with people who don't do drugs, maybe, or like even if that's not like these things like can spread by other means.",23,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"like like if you get HIV or aids, if, like you bleed on to someone and like it can get into contact with someone else, or like saliva, even in some other kinds of diseases.",24,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"so it's like this is like diseases can spread and you don't want to just like let people die of these diseases, because that has a really wide social impact.",25,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, clearly you want to make sure that you like keep maintaining public health.",26,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"There's a reason why international health organizations maintain these things, also, these things are literally like like these things are like pennies out of national budget, it's like, these things probably cost like point one percent of a national budget.",27,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"These things aren't actually all that meaningful as far as like like the money is concerned, but they are really meaningful on the individual level.",28,,
DJ_2458_needle-exchange_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, don't abolish needle exchange programs.",29,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,International volunteering brings more good than harm for two big reasons.,1,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"First, because I think that international volunteering helps create a sense of awareness and understanding of the culture, and when you bring this back to your home country, this results in you being better able to connect and better able to represent them from a policy perspective.",2,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"and secondarily, I think that international volunteering, just like straight up, helps people straight up, makes people's lives better, and that's good.",3,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about this awareness and policy point.",4,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Keep in mind that when you go to a place to internationally volunteer- like, let's say, like you go to like uganda or southeast asia or something like that you're, you're going to necessarily become immersed in that area's language, that area's culture, that area's food, what their religious norms may be, what their social norms or values may be.",5,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,you're going to like learn a whole lot about these people.,6,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,", you're also going to understand the concerns that they have, the day to day worries they have because you're going to truly live amongst them.",7,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And this is important because this puts like a real human face on these people.,8,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"It makes sure that in the most intimate way, you actually try to like at least as best as you can as an outsider, understand what some people are going through.",9,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And, that's really important because, when you see , when you see policy makings happen that affect a whole lot of people in the international community that are the beneficiaries of volunteering, it oftentimes come with like a gross disregard for how other people are actually going to think about that.",10,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So when you bring this perspective back to your home country, when you bring back this like more intercultural understanding, you're going to be able to assess the way you choose to go into these policy field, which most people do after internationally volunteering- in some places a lot of these people do go into activism- you're going to have like a better.",11,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,you're going to have like a better capacity to actually inform policies and make better judgment calls.,12,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Second, I think that international volunteering is good because it just straight up helps people.",13,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So like what's a concrete example of this?,14,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,A lot of people teach english and debate like british parliamentary debate in rwanda to people who wanna learn there or things like this.,15,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Other people may do things like build houses in places or the like.,16,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So these things are good because when you're helping people like international volunteers, they're not just like sitting around on their butts the whole time, they're either teaching people practical skills or teaching people english, they could be teaching people debate, they could be teaching people like any number of things.",17,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And these are like skills that can actually help people in their lives, that could like make make their entire lives better or international volunteers are providing like tangible goods to people like, they can help build shelters they can help like, distribute food to people all of these things are like really really good.",18,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"They change people's lives for the better , and I think that they do so with like minimal cost to other people.",19,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,I think they do so with like a very minimal cost.,20,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, if people are willing to devote themselves and devote their time to doing that, and clearly these are things that like people want, like, people won't go there to volunteer unless there is some kind of like way in which they're benefiting from it.",21,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, people want to maybe like teach english in like a poor part of the world to help people engage in a global economy and clearly people in these cut parts of the world want that.",22,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Clearly people would want things like building shelters or the like things like that.,23,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,", but finally I think that all of these things oftentimes happen at much cheaper rates and that's important because when you're talking about like pretty poor parts of the world, they may not be able to afford to bring in professional teachers, they may not be able to afford to bring in as many professional contractors, professional workers or construction laborers and things like that.",24,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And, if you can't afford it, I mean it's not gonna get done, but it's these are very important things we're talking about.",25,,
DJ_2459_international-volunteering_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, international volunteering brings more good than harm.",26,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,We should subsidize renewable energy and we should subsidize renewable energy because renewable energy is just an incredibly good thing for many reasons.,1,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,And subsidies are a good way to effectively get more of that good thing.,2,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,So first why is renewable energy a good thing?,3,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,The biggest reason is climate change.,4,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,We live in a world in which climate change is going to have incredibly horrible impacts if we don't rapidly decrease the amount of CO two and other other greenhouse gas emissions that we put into the atmosphere.,5,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,And one of the biggest ways in which we emit greenhouse gases is with non renewable energies.,6,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,So whether it's the oil from our car or the coal that we burned for electricity or basic refrigeration and cooling and things like that that require that require like electricity and things like that to run.,7,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,All of these things require a large amount of non renewable energy which gets funneled into the atmosphere and all of that can be corrected with green energy.,8,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"And that's huge because without more of the impacts of climate change, you're talking about multibillion dollar costs of like essentially things like flooding and natural disasters.",9,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"obviously, crop failures and things like that are obviously problems as well.",10,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"there's a whole lot of problems that are going to come with climate change, both economic costs and real human cost, that can be avoided with these kinds of things.",11,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"But secondarily, even if that's not true, they're still going to be a need for this.",12,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,there's going to be a need for renewable energy,13,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"because there's going to be an increase in scarcity of non renewable resources, and the biggest reason for that is just",14,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,because we've been reliant on nonrenewable energy for,15,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"so long, consuming it at such fast rates that it can't possibly keep up with the that the- the rate at which it rebuilds over like tens of thousands of years, isn't able to keep up with the rate at which we're consuming it",16,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,so eventually it's all going to be gone.,17,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,And that's going to be a big deal and that we're going to need to do something about that and plan in advance.,18,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,But finally I think it's going to be better for pricing and the economy in the long run and that's true because the scarcity obviously of non renewable energies is going to lead to a rise in it.,19,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,This is something that we've already seen like oil is so much more expensive than it used to be because oil is not is like as widely abundant as it used to be.,20,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,We're not there's more of a stricter supply of oil.,21,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,So we're already seeing this kind of basic economic principle happen.,22,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,And I think this is only going to get worse because because the things that I've talked about.,23,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"So then, when you compare that to greenhouse gases, you're talking about things that can be done incredibly cheaply and efficiently in the long run, whether it's just putting up a panel and taking in sunlight, not having to worry about a whole lot of various costs that are related to nonrenewable energy production.",24,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"in the long run, green technologies and renewable energies are going to be a whole lot cheaper.",25,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,So I think that subsidies are an incredibly good way to get more of this good thing.,26,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,They're a good way to get more of this good thing because there subsidies are going to directly increase investment in it whether you're a researcher or developer getting an investment or you're a consumer that's getting some kind of subsidies for doing some kind of consumers related subsidy.,27,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,This is obviously going to increase the prevalence of renewable energy which is great.,28,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"But also this is going to lead to a signaling effect and a snowball effect,",29,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"because the more people that are encouraged to use renewable energies, the more widely normalize it's going to be and also there's going to be greater economies of scale,",30,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,"because when things like production plants for cars are now focusing on electric cars instead of oil based cars and it becomes cheaper to produce what, it becomes cheaper to produce the renewable alternatives",31,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,And that basic economic principle can be expanded over a whole lot of other things.,32,,
DJ_2460_renewable-energy_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons definitely subsidize renewable energy.,33,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"No, we should not further exploit small modular reactors for two big reasons.",1,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"First, because I think that the exploitation of small modular reactors as a form of nuclear energy would necessarily come at the expense of superior alternatives like solar energy or hydroelectric energy or other kinds of green technology, and additionally I think that it would lead to nuclear proliferation which is not very good for the safety of anyone.",2,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about the first one, the opportunity cost this presents, because I think that people , you're talking about two different kinds of technologies that you're going to invest a lot of money up front in.",3,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"To set up a small modular reactor or to set up possibly a bunch of solar panels, and wind farms or things like that.",4,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, these are both new things that are going to be deviations from the status quo, and they're going to require up front investment.",5,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So in order to do that, you're going to see a lot of people choosing which one are they going to invest in for their like, for a move for a more recent alternate source of energy.",6,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that this is important because, as we can see from, like current infrastructure in america and a lot of other places around the world, like infrastructure isn't always all that up to date.",7,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"it's something that it's easy to what you have it, leave it behind and not do all that much updating of it.",8,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,so I think that it's really it's really important make sure that we target the initial breakthrough in the decision that we're making.,9,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that people, when they're choosing what would be best, and have limited money to invest and they have little money for what they're purchasing.",10,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, I think that when you have as an option small modular reactors, people are going to be tempted to pick that over green technology.",11,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But I think that's inherently bad because you want to have an emphasis on things that are going to be more environmentally friendly than the nuclear energy.,12,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"I also think that they're going, it's going to be just more stable in the long term because you're not going to have to worry about like something running out you're not going to worry about the like, use of all these resources, and it's also eventually going to be cheaper.",13,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because recognize that while it may be like right now not , it while it may be more economically efficient right now to invest in nuclear energy than certain kinds of less efficient green technology, that's going to change in the near future because of a lot of investment.",14,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"However if that investment comes and the prices go down too late when people are already using a different source of technology or unwilling to change, then you're not actually going to be getting a lot of solutions for these problems.",15,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So I think that eventually green technology is going to be cheaper because is so easy to just like rely on, like the sun.",16,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,you don't have to have like just having a panel that soaks in sunlight or things like that.,17,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"once that's sufficient enough to be done in a really effective way, that's going to be way easier and way cheaper than having immense operations and reactors and facilities to do all these things.",18,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, now that all that is established, let's talk about the second reason why small modular reactors are bad, and that it would lead to widespread nuclear proliferation which is very very bad.",19,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So nuclear proliferation is bad because , well, it's bad in that the small modular reactors is a form of nuclear energy obviously require uranium and uranium can be, uranium is bad for two big reasons.",20,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,First because it can be very dangerous for accidents.,21,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, obviously, small modular reactors.",22,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"they may be newer, they may be more efficient and up to date, they may even be more secure,",23,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"but the fact that there's going to be more of them in more spread out locations, especially",24,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"because it's oftentimes difficult to get consistent standards of quality and maintenance and security and things like that, you're going to be making it much more likely that some kind of accident is going to happen",25,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe like like get it like, worst case explosion more minor situation could be like a leak or a melt down, it could be like a leak or it could be a spillage of some kind, that would be very very bad.",26,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But additionally this could also mean that maybe weapons could be more likely to because there's gonna be more of a widespread network of access to uranium.,27,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So like maybe it'll be easier for people to enrich uranium uranium two which would be very very bad.,28,,
DJ_2465_small-modular-reactors_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, for all those reasons, we should not further exploit small modular reactors.",29,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not exploit geothermal energy because exploiting geothermal energy will necessarily come at the expense of other more superior forms of green technology like solar energy.,1,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So let's start by talking about why that's the case, and the biggest reason is just because of the way economies of scale works and investment in new technologies is going to work.",2,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Right now when we're faced with having to transition from fossil fuels that we've used for centuries to green technologies, we're faced with a lot of difficulties in replicating the degree to which fossil fuels are easy to use and cheap.",3,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So in doing so we want to make sure that we can in order to make green technologies viable, we need to make sure that it's as cheap as possible, it's is widely usable as possible, and it's as efficient and effective as possible.",4,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So how are you going to do that?,5,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"By concentrating your resources into the most viable form of alternative energy, and this makes sense because there's a whole lot of investment that's going to be associated with green technologies.",6,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"You have to reinvest in your energy grid, you have to do research and development into the specific kind of technology, you have to manufacture and roll out the product itself, there's all kinds of costs that are going to be associated and investments that are going to be required.",7,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, when you have it more concentrated, economies of scale are going to kick in and you're instead of having like research happen, instead of hiring- like",8,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"two terms of like- teams of researchers to research different kinds of technologies, you can now focus that and go into like invest more in",9,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,one kind of technology and that makes it more likely that you're going to have breakthroughs in development that are going to make any,10,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,one kind of technology cheaper and better to use,11,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So given this, why should we be investing predominantly in solar energy even at the expense of geothermal energy?",12,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And this is very clear.,13,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"First, solar energy will be much more widely usable.",14,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,One of the best things about it is that the sun is everywhere.,15,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Even when it's cloudy, ultraviolet rays are still bouncing energy onto the surface and therefore if you have a panel there no matter what the weather is you're still going to be getting a good degree of solar energy.",16,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but, moreover, you also have the benefits of panel placement, in that you can literally just have roofs or sidewalks or driveways or parking lot be covered with solar panels, which makes it much more versatile in the places in which you can use it, rather than geothermal energy, which is only concentrated predominantly in areas that have higher levels of seismic activity,",17,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,so maybe places where there's like active fault lines or things like that,18,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,There's also matters of like transportation since solar energy can be more decentralized and that like you can power individual houses with solar panels instead of having to worry about transporting that energy from a centralized like hub to that house that would be much more efficient because you lose energy oftentimes in terms of like transformation and transportations.,19,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"That's really good, but moreover, solar energy can also in the long term be very cheap with only minimal maintenance cost needed.",20,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"You literally just put the panel on, do some wiring, and it's going to do the work for you.",21,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,You're not going to have to do like complex underground drilling operations or putting apparatuses in place deep underground to like harvest the energy of like the earth's heat all of which will probably cost a whole lot more in terms of like economic money in terms of money so that's incredibly beneficial.,22,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But it's also just going to be better for the environment too.,23,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Solar panels are going to be minimally destructive as opposed to having to like go deep underground into like areas of high seismic activity in order to like harvest energy there.,24,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"oftentimes, areas of high seismic activity are also currently like protected places, so places like yellowstone national park have incredibly high degrees like high levels of geothermal energy, and that's also oftentimes why there's incredibly beautiful landscapes there with very fragile ecosystems that you definitely don't want to mess with.",25,,
DJ_2474_geothermal-energy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should not exploit geothermal energy.",26,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,We should ban targeted killings because targeted killings are inherently unjust and a horrible thing to use and they also carry too much of a risk for abuse so we have to stop using them altogether.,1,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why targeted killings are just always bad.,2,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,And this goes to the heart of the way in which we determine guilt and culpability and things like that.,3,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,"Especially because oftentimes people are using them on their own citizens as a means of extra judicial assassinations, such as when the US orders drone strikes on american citizens who are suspected of terrorism.",4,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,It's essentially a way to subvert the criminal justice system.,5,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,And this is a big problem because guilt isn't just something that exists in your mind or it's isn't some kind of knowledge.,6,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,You can't know somebody is guilty of some crime because because guilt isn't something that you know.,7,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,You are guilty if you are proven guilty in a court of law.,8,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,So if you shoot somebody but you're not proven guilty then you're not actually guilty of that time.,9,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,It's the basis of guilty of proven innocence.,10,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,And this goes to like the heart of basically like a fundamental thing that we hold true dear in a free society.,11,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,Because there's obviously nothing worse than like losing your freedom.,12,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,And getting targeted for an extra judicial assassination is one of the worst ways to lose your freedom.,13,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,Because the government taking away like the thing that's most important to you.,14,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,It's taking away your life.,15,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,"And it's doing so to you without due process, without any kind of rights, without any semblance of possibly a proportional punishment, without any semblance of any kind of justice whatsoever.",16,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,"They're just doing what they want to do because they look at you as some threat and nothing more and not even worthy of any kind of basic dignity or rights or process that's involved, that is required in order for something to be just.",17,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,"So beyond all of that it's also unjust because targeted killings are, it's rather a bad name because targeted killings tend to be rather poorly targeted in a lot of circumstances, targeted killing means you it oftentimes means you're firing a drone into the building.",18,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,And drones are basically glorified missiles oftentimes in a lot of ways.,19,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,"So when you fire a drone strike in a building where he where you suspect terrorists, it's not like in some tiny sniper that's going to only kill the one person that you're targeting.",20,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,You're firing a damn missile at a building.,21,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,The other people in that building are probably not going to get out of it alive.,22,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,"So when you have like oftentimes like family families that live in these places, innocent civilians who just happen to be neighbors.",23,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,"Militaries are oftentimes quick so write this off as simply collateral damage, which is, besides the fact that it just like like obviously immoral to just write off people's lives as collateral damage, it is like completely heinous, but beyond all of that, beyond that just being immoral, I also think that this is simply right for abuse.",24,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,Because one of the biggest checks that we have against war historically and in reality is the fact that wars can be very expensive and we don't like it when our soldiers die.,25,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,So it prevents us from over-using from over going to war to often.,26,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,Over-using war as an option.,27,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,Because war is an unpopular option when it's an expensive and it comes with the risk of human life.,28,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,But targeted killings are too easy.,29,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,"When you're just when you're just pushing a button and then to drone fires a missile at somebody, there's no real human life that's in danger for your own people, only the lives of other people.",30,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,And it's a comparatively cheap option in a lot of ways.,31,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,"So it's incredibly easy to use drone strikes, and they're very likely to be abused because there's not really much of a cost of actually using them.",32,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,You don't suffer the cost.,33,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,The people on the the people who you're targeting in their country are often times suffering the cost.,34,,
DJ_2478_targeted-killing_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should ban targeted killings.,35,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,We should ban racial profiling for two reasons.,1,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,First because it's a violation of rights and second because it actually makes people less safe.,2,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"So first, why is racial profiling a violation of rights?",3,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,Let's start by looking at the fact that it is an inherent rights violation.,4,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"Because the because by the lottery of birth, people don't really have any control over where they're born into.",5,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"That's not something that you actually choose, you don't choose the color of your skin.",6,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"Or the religion that you grow up with, it's probably picked out by your parents.",7,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,So why do we think that this is important?,8,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"Because when you are profiling somebody on the base of their race, especially assuming criminality or terrorist motives to the basis of their race, or to a heightened presumption that they might be a perpetrator of such an action, it assigns blame to a race where it presumes blame onto a predominant group of people rather than assigning blame to individual people.",9,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,This is an incredibly big problem.,10,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"Because what it essentially is is a form of discrimination, because it means that the reason why someone is committing a crime is because they're a criminal because they have bad morals but that doesn't have anything to do with the color of their skin or the way in which they grew up.",11,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,But this is additionally yeah besides this just being an inherent rights violation we also believe that this will likely be a rights violation in the way that it's applied.,12,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,Because oftentimes police are able to take advantage of the leniency of society when it comes to safety measures.,13,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"This is very true in america, obviously, where you see shootings of unarmed black men on a tragically regular basis.",14,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,And that oftentimes convictions rarely if if ever follow and penalties are hardly ever more than a slap on the wrist.,15,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,This is clearly evident of a culture in which these things are permissible but additionally society also just scares easily.,16,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"You hear about instances of street harassment and bullying, acts of hate crimes against people, acts of hate crimes against muslims and islamophobia as rampant, and these things are oftentimes stroked by media fears.",17,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"and when you and when you allow the use of racial profiling, it essentially legitimizes that race can be a characteristic that could lead you wanting to identify somebody as a terrorist in the media and things like that.",18,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,So then I also think makes is like quite a violation of their rights because this is simply undeserved on their part.,19,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,But the next thing that I want to talk about is that I actually think that this makes society less safe.,20,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"So first because it creates a presumption of where the threat is coming from, or expectation of who is actually threatening you that is ultimately not all that helpful in actually fighting threats.",21,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,Because terrorists and criminals belong to people of all races and religions and that just because some more happen to be come from some groups of people other than other groups of people when there is racial profiling allowed it usually focuses on the most prevalent groups.,22,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,This often comes at the expense of us not considering the threats that can come from people whom we may not expect them to come from.,23,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,So this ultimately makes you less safe in a lot of ways too.,24,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,But this is finally going to make people less safe because of the way in which the targeted groups of racial profiling react to this.,25,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"So even if you can make arguments that this isn't actually a violation of rights, the reality is is that the people involved in this, the people being targeted by this, do believe it is a rights violation.",26,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,"It means that it's just another example of society condemning these people who are already oftentimes not treated very well in society at large so I think that if anything this is going to make it more likely that people are going to, on the margins, turn to extremism or terrorism or more radical sects altogether.",27,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,And this is because they're going to be seen as less accepted by mainstream society.,28,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,They're not going to ever feel like they're secure in their own identity.,29,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,This is an incredibly this is incredibly messed up thing and it ultimately only makes it our society less safe and less secure.,30,,
DJ_2480_racial-profiling_pro.trs.txt,So for all of those reasons we should definitely ban racial profiling.,31,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,We should ban frats because the culture surrounding frats and the actions that they take are inherently harmful and there's really no way to fix it.,1,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,You have to get rid of it altogether.,2,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what exactly it is about fraternities that makes them so problematic and the culture around them so toxic.,3,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,There are several things here.,4,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,So first the harmful acts that it perpetuates in terms of things like rape culture and sexual assault and violence against women.,5,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,When you hear about college sexual assaults and the like while they're often while they can obviously oftentimes be from other sources oftentimes these things happen at college parties and more often than not they happen at fraternities that are hosting these parties.,6,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,And I think that there is a couple of things under this and first and foremost fraternities don't do nearly enough to prevent the sexual assaults that happen on their watch in fact they oftentimes try to actively encourage it in ways such as trying to get as many women as possible to the party trying to get those women as drunk as possible.,7,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,Trying to pressure women into sex in every way possible.,8,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,And engaging in all kinds of behavior to make it so that it's more likely that there is an environment in which women are going to be victims of sexual assault.,9,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,Additionally frats are also pretty harmful in terms of the hazing that they do.,10,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,And while there's been attempts to crackdown they haven't been very successful and you still see people dying people going to the hospital people getting seriously injured as a result of a a result of hazing.,11,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,But finally there's also there's also not always intentional but there's accidental harm that comes from fraternities.,12,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,Whether it's like alcohol overdoses and needed to get hospitalized and then getting your stomach pumped or drug overdoses or accidents related to drunkenness like falling off a roof because like those things happen sometimes.,13,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,Those kinds of things are also more common when you have fraternities that are perpetuating a party culture.,14,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,So all of those things lead to both intentional and unintentional harms and all those things can be linked to fraternities.,15,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,So why aren't these things necessarily going to be changed.,16,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,Why can't you just try to encourage better practices amongst fraternities?,17,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,And I think that there's a couple of reasons for this.,18,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,First and foremost I think they are often times unwilling.,19,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,I think that we should talk about how fraternities are perpetuating rape culture or how hazing is problematic or things like that.,20,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,Oftentimes fraternities tend to get incredibly defensive.,21,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,They try to point to other good things that they do you like community service and look at that as an excuse for harmful actions in other walks of life.,22,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,They're oftentimes saying that these are part of traditions that these are things that they've been doing for an incredibly long time or they'll even try to say that there's nothing wrong with trying to like get women as drunk as possible as long as they their idea of consent is being met.,23,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,So I think that there is an inherent unwillingness and push back that often comes with fraternities.,24,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,But moreover I also think that the community itself is incredibly toxic in a lot of ways.,25,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,Because I think that beyond that unwillingness I think that there is a group mentality that I think that there's a group mentality that makes it so that changes is less likely because because of these traditions that are going to make it so that it's steeped in.,26,,
DJ_2481_fraternities_pro.trs.txt,So I think for all of those reasons we should just ban fraternities and be done with it.,27,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,We should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools because at the end of the day drugs and guns have no place in schools whatsoever.,1,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,There's no rational reason for them to be in schools and I don't really think that there's any actual real consequence of outright banning these things and having zero tolerance policies that are very strict.,2,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,But first I want to talk about possible misconceptions because keep in mind that mistakes are not necessarily things that we think should fall under a zero policy tolerance policy.,3,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,"So for example, if somebody brings like some kind of toy to school and it gets mistaken for some kind of weapon or somebody brings oregano and it gets mistaken for marijuana or something like that.",4,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,These sound like things in which the school has a responsibility to actually make sure that it's ban is attacking the things that it should be banning and I think that mistakes are ultimately going to be proven as mistakes.,5,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,You're going to find out eventually when you confiscate the item if you get caught with it whether or not it's true or valid.,6,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,So I don't think that those things should be a part of the debate.,7,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,So what are the things that we're actually talking about?,8,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,"We're talking about things that have a real danger to people: guns, drugs, things like that.",9,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,So I don't think that these things have any place in school.,10,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,I think that there's absolutely no reason whatsoever why someone should ever need to have drugs in school.,11,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,You don't just accidentally bring heroin or cocaine or marijuana to school.,12,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,"You probably are doing that with a purpose and that purpose is likely either to distribute it or to use it, neither of which should be acceptable on school grounds.",13,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,"School is supposed to be a place of learning and drugs even at their like least harmful level, even if like you want to have a debate about the degree to which they are harmful, at the very least you're probably not able to study or learn very well when you're on drugs.",14,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,So I really don't see why they have a place there but they're also probably very dangerous and generally shouldn't be there.,15,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,"When we're talking about weapons, these are obviously things that you can't have on campus on at schools.",16,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,Especially in a society where there is a lot of gun violence and where there is a good deal of like threat that people may misuse their weapon and especially in a society where a lot of gun deaths are ultimately accidental in nature.,17,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,"I think that even if like people don't have any kind of intent to do harm, even if people may be otherwise legally able to carry a firearm, I do not think that the school a school is a place where these weapons should be had.",18,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,Because keep in mind there's not really a whole lot of reason why you should have these otherwise.,19,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,You won't be needing it for sport when you're on school grounds and I don't think that.,20,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,"as far as defense is concerned, if you feel like you need some kind of weapon, whether it's a gun or a knife, on a school campus, then the danger that you're feeling is much, much greater than it should be for a child to deal with, and they should be going to an authority or somebody who has a better capacity to actually deal with these things.",21,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,"So I really don't see, since there's no argument for sport, there's no argument for self defense, any real reason why you should be able to have a weapon.",22,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,I don't see any reason why you would need one.,23,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,I don't see any reason why you can mistakenly bring one in most cases and I don't see why we should care if it's an accident or not given that these accidents are dangerous too.,24,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,"And at the end of the day you need to have zero tolerance, you need to have this level of punishment, you need to have that level of deterrence to make sure that people aren't bringing guns into the classroom.",25,,
DJ_2496_zero-tolerance_pro.trs.txt,So for those reasons we should adopt a zero tolerance policy in schools.,26,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,We should keep the drinking age where it is at twenty one years old because lowering the drinking age would be quite bad for the health of young people.,1,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So first and foremost let's talk about why drinking is bad for the health of young people.,2,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Why alcohol is bad for young people.,3,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"First and foremost, people's brains aren't fully done maturing and developing until about age twenty one.",4,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Certainly by age eighteen people are still learning, people are still growing, as are their brains.",5,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And this is very important because alcohol is proven to mess up your brain in a lot of ways.,6,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"To stunt its ability to grow, to kill to kill aspects of it.",7,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"And that's a really big problem because when therefore when you allow people to take alcohol at a young age, you're essentially allowing them to poison their development.",8,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Which is obviously not something that we should want.,9,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"The second thing though is that do do a due to increased lack of maturity that's more likely to be present in younger people, there's more of a likelihood that they're going to experience the worst aspects of alcohol.",10,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,This is for a couple of reasons: first and foremost because younger people are less likely to be mature.,11,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,They're more likely going to act irresponsibly when they're under the influence of alcohol.,12,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Younger people are gonna be more likely to do reckless behaviors like drive drunk, to get into like fights drunk, to do other kinds of disturbances for society while drunk.",13,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And that's obviously a big problem.,14,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"But additionally, younger people are also more likely to be influenced on by alcohol in very insidious ways.",15,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"When people start drinking at a younger age they're more likely to abuse alcohol, form lifelong habits, possibly more likely to get addicted to it as well, because they're being influenced by it at a very young age and it becomes just like a real part of their existence.",16,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Besides all those reasons though I wanna talk about why keeping the drinking age where it is is actually a pretty effective way of limiting the access of alcohol to younger people.,17,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that this is true because it's quite obvious that the status quo isn't like a wholly enforceable thing.,18,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Like we're not we're not gonna pretend that we can a hundred percent prevent younger people from being able to access alcohol, but we think that on like as a point of comparison, more young people are going to struggle to access alcohol if the drinking age is higher, and that's still a win for us.",19,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So why is this true?,20,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,First and foremost because you limit the context in which people can get alcohol.,21,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"You can't just walk into a bar, or walk into a store and get alcohol if you're a younger person now, in the same way that you can get like a fruit smoothie or something.",22,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,You have to rely on other people.,23,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Are you have to rely on older friends, which a lot of young people don't have.",24,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Like if you're a freshman in high school you probably don't know all that many like senior, not even senior, like you probably don't know all that many older people who are like college age people.",25,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Additionally a lot of parents may not be ok supplying alcohol for their kids, or if they are willing to do it, they're more likely going to be able to exert more control over the way in which it is happening.",26,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So people, like whether its friends or family members, aren't going to want to be legally responsible for possible consequences of like throwing a rage or a party or something like that.",27,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So if parents are willing to like supply people with alcohol at all, it's probably more likely going to be in a more responsible and controlled setting which makes it more likely that you're going to responsibly use that alcohol.",28,,
DJ_2502_drinking-age_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should not lower the drinking age.,29,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"We should allow fracking because fracking is an incredibly useful tool and it's a rather effective way to get energy, at least in the short term while we're still in the early stages of green and sustainable technologies.",1,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And when you're looking on the comparative, since a lot of green technologies simply aren't feasible and realistic right now, you need to look at this discussion as a comparison between fracking and between other kinds of sources.",2,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So like coal mining or importing oil from like the middle east, or or oil drilling in the gulf of mexico for example.",3,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that fracking is often better than all the things.,4,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So first and foremost fracking is cheap.,5,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Fracking is oftentimes a whole lot cheaper than other alternatives, which is great.",6,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And the reason for that comes from a lot of varieties.,7,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"first of all, fracking can often be done in america, so that means that it's closer.",8,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,you can cut out transportation costs.,9,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"it happens in abundance there and it also happens in like, and because it's still like a like a non renewable energy, there's a lot of like economies of scale in place that still make it really cheap.",10,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Secondarily it's it's abundant as well.,11,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Whether it's like north dakota or pennsylvania or other places, there's a whole lot of areas that are right for fracking, and this can give us a whole lot of access to oil resources in a time where oil production is likely going to start to decrease in more conventional means.",12,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And that's obviously something that's very important if you wanna make sure that we still have the capability to use oil as we need it.,13,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Additionally we shouldn't undersell the value of of having our own reliance on of being like dependent on only ourselves for technology, for being depend on only ourselves for oil and energy as opposed to having to be dependent on the middle east.",14,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because this allows foreign actors to exert more control over US policy, because if they don't like something that they're doing, they can try to hike up oil prices.",15,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,they can use that at least as leverage or as a bargaining tool in negotiations for favorable deals or agreements.,16,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,all of these things make it so that it's a whole lot better when you're dependent on your own supply of energy.,17,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Because you don't want to have such an important vital sector of your economy be in the hands of actors who may not necessarily have your interests at heart.,18,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"The next thing that I would argue is that I think this is oftentimes preferable , in terms of environmental damage, to other alternatives.",19,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So like obviously it's not great for the environment when you're injecting like chemicals into the grounds of north dakota to extract things, but at the very least, I still think that that's probably better than like say drilling for oil in the gulf of mexico.",20,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because at least if you're doing it in like a landed area, in like the mountains, or more isolated location in pennsylvania, or or north dakota or something like that, at the very least it has less of an opportunity for like spill over and problems like that.",21,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like you're not going to have to worry about like doing these kinds of things in the ocean, in the gulf of mexico, where there's a risk for huge oil spills that are like literally catastrophes for wildlife.",22,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We are oftentimes going to see this be much better off for the environment on a comparative level for that extent.,23,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But also we've been destroying the environment in america for for generations and I don't think this is going to make it meaningfully all that much worse.,24,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should allow fracking.",25,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"We should ban fracking because fracking is horrible for the environment, and it's going to be horrible for well so it's bad for the environment in the short term, it's gonna be bad for the environment in the long term, and it's also bad for people in the short term and the long term.",1,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,So all of these those things are bad.,2,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start by why it's really bad for the environment in the short term.",3,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,These things are really obvious.,4,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"When you look at the data of like seismic disturbances in places where fracking is happening, places like pennsylvania, places like north dakota, you start to see an alarming trend emerge.",5,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"And this trend is that places that aren't on active fault lines, places that aren't really known for having any kind of particular history of seismic activity are suddenly seeing like micro earthquakes and sometimes even major earthquakes.",6,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"These plays are seeing like sinkholes, these places are seeing all kinds of like clear signs of environmental contamination and environmental destruction.",7,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"And these kinds of things have a huge impact on people in the sense that like when there's like a like a earthquakes in places where they aren't usually happening or where there're sinkholes that are happening that just like randomly, and these can be be massive sinkholes, that can swallow up people's houses.",8,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,Obviously those are really critical problems.,9,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"But when you look at it in a broader sense too, the picture that fracking paints isn't any less dire.",10,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"Because when you're injecting chemicals into the ground, injecting chemicals into wells that people oftentimes draw water from, when you're injecting chemicals into the ground that ultimately then when there's rain results in runoff, which goes into local food supplies, local water supplies, and all other kinds of things, what you end up seeing is you see widespread contamination.",11,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,You see the very same aluminum alloys and sands that are getting injected into the earth ultimately end up in like water that can get and like absorbed by food.,12,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"And that happens because like once you put something into the ground, you can't just accept that you can't just expect it to sit there under the earth.",13,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,That's not the way the environment works.,14,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"There's things are oftentimes like moving around, constantly being moved around by forces like wind, rain, earth moves like earth movement in itself, and other kinds of natural forces.",15,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,So all of these kinds of pollutions eventually end up in like ultimately hurts humans as well.,16,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"This is the same way in like, for example, when you like put lead somewhere, and like the lead it like obviously if you're not if you're like in like just like around lead, that can be really harmful for you.",17,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"In the same way, that's like a big problem with like other kinds of chemicals that we commonly use in humans for humans.",18,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"Because when these things get absorbed into our food, whether it's like an aluminum alloy or whatever the hell they put into these chemicals that they use to break up rock, literally chemicals that break up rock can be seeping into our food supply.",19,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"I don't think that's something that sounds very good to any reasonable, thinking person.",20,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"But besides all of those other kinds of impacts, let's look beyond that to the impact this has in the longer term, the impact that this has on global warming, and the impact that this has on our ability to convert over to a cleaner economy.",21,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,And I think that this is really bad as well.,22,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"Because we're investing such large quantities of money in the fracking boom essentially that when we put all of this upfront investment into fracking, it's definitely going to keep being cheaper to do fracking.",23,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"It'll be keep being cheaper to rely on fossil fuels and other kind of polluting fuels as opposed to green technologies, and the big reason for that is because instead of investing in better green technologies, we're funneling all this money into better ways to break apart the earth and just and get chemicals into the earth so we can get oil out of it.",24,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should absolutely ban fracking to help combat global warming, to help combat food contamination and pollution, and to help combat the like horrible seismic consequences that come with it.",25,,
DJ_2524_fracturing_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, ban fracking.",26,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,We should not abolish the double jeopardy defense because the double jeopardy defense is a vital protection to protect people against government abuse and government harassment.,1,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,So why do I think that this is a very big problem?,2,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Because a common thing could be, oh, governments won't want to waste their time, governments won't want to waste money prosecuting people over and over again just for the sake of it if they think that they're going to lose again.",3,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"And honestly I think that that's nonsense because if there's one thing that governments around the world like doing, governments love spending money on putting people in in jails or ensuring compliance with the law.",4,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,And certainly like governments like the american government.,5,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"When you look at the amount of money that gets spent on prisons, the amount of money that gets spent on law enforcement, the amount of money that gets spent on the military, you spend like trillions and trillions of dollars more on these kinds of things then you do on other things like science or education or welfare and things like that.",6,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So I think that first and foremost, on face, the idea that governments won't try to abuse the the lack of a double jeopardy provision to harass people is foolish.",7,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"I think it's foolish because governments are always going to have an incentive to try and get more convictions, try to put take people off the street that they look at as criminals.",8,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,I think that this is just something like it's in many ways a like part of the fabric of society and it's certainly something that's empirically true.,9,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that what we're likely going to see is that in a world in which there's no double jeopardy defense and someone gets acquitted of a crime, you're going to see prosecutors say, well it was just the jury, we're going to try again.",10,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"The judge was too liberal, we're going to try again.",11,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Oh, well, we didn't get enough evidence this time, we're going to try again when we get more evidence.",12,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"And they're going to keep making excuses and things like that and say, you know what, we just didn't do this thing right, we can do this thing better.",13,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,Because they know that at the end of the day what people want more than anything is getting criminals off the street.,14,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,That's the way that incentives flow.,15,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"But additionally, how is this going to look?",16,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,Because oftentimes people are in prison while they're awaiting trial.,17,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,You look at things like bail can be very expensive and people can't afford bail so you could have people being almost detained indefinitely which is one of the whole points of like a lot of the protections in the first place.,18,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"When you're awaiting a trial or if there is a fear of being retried, you could be harassed.",19,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,it could be hard to find a job or maintain employment in your life because you constantly have to be worrying about going into court.,20,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"if you did get out on bail in the first place, because the second that you do a background check it's going to see that you have pending charges against you criminally because they do record searches and things like that.",21,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,But finally there's going to be much more less of an emphasis on doing things right the first time if you're a prosecutor.,22,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Because they're going to realize, well, I can just do it over again if I don't convict the person.",23,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,I don't have to worry about being as thorough with evidence gathering the first time around because I could just do it again otherwise.,24,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,And you're almost going to be making you're going to be making people less accountable because there's no risk on the prosecution of blowing their chance to put somebody in jail.,25,,
DJ_2526_double-jeopardy_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Now you're going to create a system where they can just keep doing this over and over again and I think that that's absolutely horrible, it's definitely going to get abused, it's a violation of rights, and for all those reasons do not abolish double jeopardy.",26,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"We should absolutely prohibit corporal punishment, also more colloquially known as child abuse, and I think that the reason for that is two reasons for that are rather clear.",1,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"First, because it doesn't actually work, and second, because it's incredibly cruel and incredibly heartless thing to do, and as a moral society we should ban it.",2,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why corporal punishment is grossly ineffective and doesn't actually work.,3,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"So, obviously like there is two general groups.",4,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"Like corporal punishment could be used as like discipline for like prisoners or things like that, or it can be used for like children as a form of discipline.",5,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,I think in either instance it's grossly ineffective.,6,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"As far as, like prisoners are concerned and things like that, I think a lot of the same arguments with torture apply, in that people are more likely to be rebellious or resentful and things like that.",7,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"so you're more likely to, if you like, physically abuse prisoners.",8,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"you're more likely going to see prisoners either be violent themselves,",9,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,because the violence becomes more normalized within the cell walls,10,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"because prison guards are doing it, or it's also going to become much more of a resentment that you're going to see much more of a desire to do harm to other people, much more of a desire to do harm,",11,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"because revenge and hate, especially when somebody physically abuses you, are rather powerful and rather difficult to get rid of",12,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"I think that as far as it applies to kids, it's even more ineffective, and the reason for this is like pretty straightforward.",13,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"Most societies don't let you go too far with corporal punishment as is, if you're truly like truly injuring your kid, that's just child abuse, you could be put in prison for that.",14,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"So there's already a line that's being drawn, and it's already difficult to like meeting the try to like use corporal punishment as a tool.",15,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"But I also think that all it does is it makes kids better at lying, because if, for example, you spank a kid because they like talk back to you, or you spank a kid because they don't do their homework or whatever it is that they do, all they're probably going to do the next time is they're going to become more resentful.",16,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,they're not going to trust you.,17,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,they're not going to be open and honest with you as a parent.,18,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"they're going to look at you more as an authority figure rather than somebody that they can confide to, rather than somebody that they can open up to, because you know you probably don't talk about your feelings or your life or things like that with people who physically attack you.",19,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"So you're probably not actually going to create a very healthy relationship between between parents and children either, and there's no real reason for that to exist.",20,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"So, why is it cruel and unusual, why is it grossly why is it just like a gross thing that we should not allow at all.",21,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that like I already said, most societies already don't allow child abuse and things like that, and if they don't they certainly should, and the reason for that is because kids are incredibly vulnerable.",22,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"Kids don't have the means of like supporting themselves and defending themselves, but kids are still people.",23,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"Kids bleed like everyone else, their bones break, and they feel pain like everybody else.",24,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"And the idea that, like kids, belong to their parents or prisoners, just belong to the state, and that you can do whatever you want with them and just physically abuse them, make them suffer, is just absolutely heinous.",25,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"it's primitive in the sense that you try to cause physical pain to others to make them do what you want them to do, as if you have some kind of ownership over their body, to the point where you can just where, where you can just make them suffer for your own betterment.",26,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"I think that that's completely degrading to their own agency, to their own human lives and the own value that they have.",27,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"And that's why I think that like the physical abuse, the physical nature of corporal punishment, makes it grossly unacceptable in a modern society, and why we obviously need to ban it.",28,,
DJ_2543_corporal-punishment_pro.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, very proud to propose.",29,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,We should not increase gun control.,1,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Instead we should try to make sure that there are some protections to ensure responsible use of guns.,2,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,However I do not think that we necessarily have to regulate guns themselves and I actually think there's problems associated with that.,3,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So I wanna start by talking about what we actually see as the the biggest problem.,4,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Because I think that while it's oftentimes maybe like alluring to look at instances of like gun massacres as evidence of gun problems in places like america.,5,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,In the vast majority of gun violence cases these aren't actually the bigger problems.,6,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,The vast majority of gun violence in america comes from one of two things: first of all it comes from just accidents - the fact that a lot of people have guns and don't necessarily are able to like responsibly get them.,7,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"But that's not because the guns themselves so much as we don't have enforcement on responsible ownership of guns, but that doesn't mean that we don't have to necessarily cut off ownership itself.",8,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"It could just mean, for example, you could require somebody to more securely lock up their gun so that a toddler can't get access to it by accident.",9,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Or you require more classes on gun ownership and gone maintenance, or conflict the escalation training and things like that.",10,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"The second thing though is that in addition to the fact that there's like accidents associated with it, a lot of gun violence just comes from not legal guns.",11,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"And this is true because like if you have a criminal record of any kind, it's not like you can just get a gun, and a huge amount of gun violence is regarding people who like already is done by people who already have criminal records who may not otherwise have the means to like access guns, so they're usually done via like illegal channels.",12,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"And here's the problem: you're not going to be able to really cut that off no matter what, because there's always going to be a supply of guns.",13,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Like there's global gun suppliers on the black market, there's people in america who do these kinds of things to, and there's always gonna be people willing to buy and willing to sell.",14,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"It's, in the same way in that there's always gonna be people willing to buy marijuana, there's always going to be people willing to have weapons.",15,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,It's just kind of a fact of human nature in that there's a lot of violence and that this isn't going to go away.,16,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So given that, you should recognize that if you're going to be fighting someone who may have a gun, or there's a possibility of a gun, having a gun yourself is definitely a valuable tool for self defense.",17,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"As long as you're like properly trained in it and actually know how to use the gun, it can definitely be a useful form of self defense in a lot of legitimate cases, some of them can be incredibly important.",18,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"But I think that, yeah.",19,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"But the second thing that I want to talk about is about how it's better, it's , under this is that it's better that guns are regulated in this regard than unregulated.",20,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Because if it's legal gun ownership, you're also going to be able to know like if the who is like the owner of a weapon, or things like that.",21,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So you can track its usage better and track the owners better.,22,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"The final thing that I want to talk about is about how if people wanna use guns for nonviolent like recreational purposes like hunting or shooting as like a sport, then I think that they should have every right to do so.",23,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,I don't think that these are things that inherently harm any person.,24,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Like it may not be to some people's individual taste or some environmentalist tastes if you allow people to go hunting, but as long as you have like reasonable regulations on these things, as long as you have reasonable checks on these things, there's no reason why, if this is the way people enjoy themselves, they should be restricted from doing that.",25,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"The fact that, for example, the UK shooting team has to practice in switzerland, it's absolutely ridiculous.",26,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,These are just people engaging in their own conception of what is recreational for them and there's no reason why they shouldn't be able to live their life that way.,27,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should not increase gun control.,28,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"We should absolutely increase gun control because first, guns are responsible for hordes of deaths, guns kill and they're incredibly bad.",1,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"Second, because guns are absolutely unnecessary, and third because you don't have any kind of right to a gun whatsoever, you shouldn't have any kind of right to a gun and guns are awful.",2,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"So first, why do I think that guns are just like incredibly bad for society?",3,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"I think that the data and the scientific studies on this like, and the research on this shows that guns clearly lead to more deaths in society when they're more widely available.",4,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"The reason why, like, a lot of violence is a lot less extreme in places that have stricter gun controls around the world is because when you have a lot of access to guns first, you're just obviously going to have more people who shouldn't have guns being able to find guns.",5,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"so this gives people who may be like unstable- or this could lead to people who are just like bad people- being more likely to get a gun, which means that they can just do more damage, they can kill more people, and that's going to be bad.",6,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"But I think that additionally, when there's more of a social acceptance of gun when there's more of a social norm of guns existing, and just more people in society have guns, you're going to be more likely seeing people be trigger happy.",7,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,So you're going to be seeing everyone from like police officers being more likely to shoot people because they're going to be worried about getting shot themselves.,8,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,There's all other kinds of factors that stem from a proliferation of guns in society.,9,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,It means that guns are just going to be more likely to be used because guns have more of an acceptance and that people have more of a fear of guns if they don't like use guns themselves.,10,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,These are like basic things that are reasons why there's so many documented gun deaths in places like the united states.,11,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,", but there's also like a lot of tragedies like like less are on the broad level and more on the more micro level.",12,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"There's a lot of specific tragedies or associated with guns as well, and this is",13,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"because on the like, more like- specific policy level, the way in which gun control like would work is that you can try, try to regulate guns to some extent,",14,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"but whenever someone like has a gun, they're able to kill possibly a lot of people very quickly and it can be difficult to respond to that",15,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"Because you can't watch everyone, you can't guard everywhere this is just, I mean that's impossible.",16,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,So it makes it so much easier.,17,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,When guns are around it makes it so much easier for people to do harm to other people.,18,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,But the next thing I wanna talk about is about why guns are just simply unnecessary.,19,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"So, like like there's two reasons why people think guns are important.",20,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,First because of sports and second because of self defense.,21,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,So first sport: I think sport is literally a ridiculous excuse.,22,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,If guns just like cause a lot of harm to people.,23,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,If they cause a whole lot of people to die in society then that's like a good enough reason to to like ban a sport.,24,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"That's like, This is ridiculous.",25,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,So self defense maybe a bit more legitimate.,26,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"it's a shame that it doesn't actually have any kind of semblance of like coherent value whatsoever, and the first reason for that is because you're more likely to like hurt yourself.",27,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"if you have a gun for self defense, you're more likely going to use it in an accident when you should have, or maybe your child is going to use it as in an accident",28,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"because they get into your gun, or your more likely to like shoot yourself with your gun or things like that",29,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"because you may not be able to use it properly, or someone else at your house",30,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,there's like a lot of data that shows that you're morally we're going to have like a gun being the source of an accident than actually save anyone.,31,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,But additionally I also think that like most guns you don't even need for self defense.,32,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"Like, a lot of guns that you can get, like hunting rifles or like to like likes or like sniper rifles, or like machine guns or even a semi automatic weapon, any of these kinds of guns that like have high capacity magazines that can kill people from far distances or or a lot of people in a concentrated area at once.",33,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"Like unless you're getting invaded by like a unless your home is getting invaded by a small army, you don't actually need these things for self defense.",34,,
DJ_2578_gun-control_pro.trs.txt,"So, there's also just like this over like hype like this is like this way overpowering of guns that are being allowed to be accessed by people so for all these reasons we should definitely increase gun control.",35,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"The affordable care act brings more good than harm for two big reasons: first, the affordable care act is simply a moral bill.",1,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"It is a morally good bill to have and secondarily, the affordable care act is good for the economy.",2,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"So, first, why is the affordable care act a moral bill?",3,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,Let's start by talking about some facts: it's a fact that more people are insured now after the affordable care act was passed than before.,4,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,It is particularly true that more of the people insured are more likely to be poor people.,5,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"because of, like, expanded medicaid enrollments and subsidies in lot of cases, and expanded access via the exchanges that exist now, and, additionally, because younger people are allowed to stay on their parents' enrollment plans until a later age than they previously were able to, more young people are more likely to be insured.",6,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"and, third, because people aren't worried about losing coverage because of being discriminated against by corporations because of preexisting conditions.",7,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,This means that people those other people are more likely to be covered as well.,8,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"But, in addition to more people being insured, we're more likely to also see people actually get quality and affordable insurance.",9,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"and the reason for this is because now, because of subsidies that exist, because of regulations that exist on insurance, you're less likely going to see people skip doctors appointments, skip visits, forego medical treatment because they don't think that they can afford it or because their co-pay is going to be too high.",10,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"So, this means that at the end of the day, more people are being insured and more people are healthier as a result of this.",11,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"So, the impact is that essentially, people are safer and healthier and I think that this is incredibly important because first and foremost, I think this is just the decent, moral thing to do.",12,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"I think that when people are in need, when someone is sick, when someone is potentially dying, when someone doesn't have the money to pay for something doesn't have the money to pay for their own health.",13,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,I think that the health and well-being of someone is such a basic part of living a good and fulfilling life.,14,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,it is something that is so elementary to your existence themselves.,15,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"I think that this is something that people have a right to and it is something that just ought be on face, provided to people.",16,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"But, in addition to this just being the decent thing to do, I think in a lot of ways, the state has a unique responsibility to ensure that its people are healthy and safe,",17,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"one of the big reasons why a state exists is that the state exists to provide a social safety net for people in a lot of cases when people need help getting, and it exists to make sure that people are going to be healthy and that are going to be healthy",18,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"I think this is one of the big reasons why the state exists in a lot of ways because people's health enables because the health of people essentially enables mobility, it enables democracy, it enables their dignity and their worth, it enables a whole lot of things.",19,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"People need their health to do essentially anything else in life, so if the state exists for anything, the state exists to provide basic necessities like that.",20,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"So, besides it being a moral bill, I also think that the affordable care act is good for the economy and it's good for the economy in two basic ways: first, the way in which it corrects prior strains that exist on the system and second, the way in which it creates positive externalities for the economy.",21,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"So, first, the way in which it corrects system strains, I think there's three ways in which it does this: first, by having a mandate of people buying health insurance, people who are healthy, people who may otherwise make a financial decision not to buy insurance, they're now they have to buy insurance.",22,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"This means that since there's going to be more healthy people in an insurance pool, you're now going to be able to have insurance companies offer lower rates.",23,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,They're not going to have to hike up premiums as much because there's more healthy people in the insurance pool to make up for the less healthy people in the insurance pool.,24,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"So, that's a good thing, number one.",25,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"It secondarily also led to medicare and medicaid expansions, things that were good for helping the health care of elderly people in medicaid and for poor people that weren't currently.",26,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"Third, it also means since you're required by since you're required to give medical treatment to people if they're in an emergency, even if they don't have healthcare coverage, this ensures that the that the average taxpayer isn't footing the bill for these uninsured costs that are existing.",27,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, there's also very positive externalities that are associated.",28,,
DJ_2585_affordable-care_pro.trs.txt,"Obviously, when people have people are healthier, they're better able to work, people can be workers, they're not there's gonna be more productivity, but also when people are healthy, they can spend money on other things, they can consume more, they have more social mobility because they're healthier, these are all things that are ultimately good for the economy, so, similarly, obamacare did more good than harm.",29,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,Genetically modified crops bring more harm than good for two main reasons.,1,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"First, because they monopolize control of farming to massive western corporations, and secondarily, they're not good for the environment.",2,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So let's first start by talking about what genetically modified crops actually look like in practice, and how the farming industry is changed when this system is used, as opposed to more traditional farming mechanisms that exist.",3,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, when you look at genetically modified crops and their proliferation, it's rather misleading to say that sixty eight percent profit increases have been seen for farmers, because in reality farmers aren't actually seeing these increases in profits.",4,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Corporations like monsanto are seeing this increase in profits, and the reason for this is because they are allowed to, as a result of intellectual property laws, essentially have ownership over the seeds themselves, have ownership over the modified crops strains itself.",5,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, this comes with a rather profound impact, because it means that farmers essentially in order to be competitive are forced to buy into genetically modified organisms, and are forced to pay much higher rates for these kinds of crops.",6,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So this means that local farmers are oftentimes priced out.,7,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Local farmers simply aren't able to compete and they're oftentimes not able to make enough money to actually make a living for themselves, all farmers, so being a farmer ultimately becomes something that's less profitable.",8,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But it also means that you're going to be less likely to serve towards your more like local or domestic market, and you're much more likely going to produce more commercialized strains of crops, things that ultimately aren't actually going to be as useful to fulfill the individual dietary needs of your area.",9,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So rather than growing maybe a more diverse array of food, you're more likely going to simply focus on only building on only growing things like maybe modified wheat or things like that, which is ultimately going to lead to you having less of the diversity in the foods that you grow as well.",10,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But in addition to the harms that this has for local farmers, we also think that this is incredibly bad for the environment.",11,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So, it's obvious that genetically modified crops are designed so that they can have a good short term result in in terms of their ability to be resistant to diseases and the like, because obviously they're modified sometimes to be pesticide resistant.",12,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But the problem that comes with this is the process of genetically modifying crops means you're going to sacrifice the diversity of strains of different crops, you're going to have less different kinds of a similar crops, you'll have maybe less kinds of avocado, less kinds of orange, in order to have the one ideal modified kind of crop.",13,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"Now, this crop may have short term immunities to certain diseases, however ultimately diseases evolve and adapt in order to infect these kinds of organisms.",14,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So this window is only going to be short term at best.,15,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"And this is actually quite bad, because you're much more likely going to see, since there's going to be a unified like one single strain.",16,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"If there is any one disease that is able to infect this strain, it's going to have much wider impacts.",17,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So in a lot of ways biodiversity is incredibly important, because it's a built-in safety net against the eradication of entire like pools of a species or entire genes, because it ultimately makes sure that a virus can only infect so so many aspects of a gene tree.",18,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"However this protection goes away when you have genetically modified crops, because they're all going to be the same.",19,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,So you don't have this kind of similarity against that.,20,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So in the likely event that a genetically so like in the likely event that an greater disease is going to infect crops, you're much more likely going to have things like food shortages, things that are going to be quite bad.",21,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"But finally, this is also bad for the environment because it encourages the growth of food in places that maybe it shouldn't be grown.",22,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"If food can't naturally grow somewhere, then it probably shouldn't be growing somewhere, and oftentimes growing food in places that it shouldn't be grown can be pretty bad for the environment.",23,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"You can sap the soil of its natural nutrients, that way other plants can't grow, oftentimes the process of growing means you're going to cut down other things that have been already existing there, so habitat destruction is going to be more likely.",24,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,There's a whole lot of reasons why people shouldn't be growing in a lot of these places.,25,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,And all of those things are more likely to happen when you have genetically modified crops.,26,,
DJ_2586_genetically-modified-crops_con_EH_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, genetically modified crops bring more harm than good.",27,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not subsidize journalism for two big reasons.,1,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"First, off I think journalism is a waste of money, and it props up an archaic way of actually getting news and information, and secondarily I think that this is the subsidizing of journalism by presumably governments, is going to create a lot of problems with respect to freedom of speech and independence of the press, and actually impacts the content of our information itself.",2,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about why I just think it is a waste of money.",3,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Honestly I, think that the organizations that provide the most value in terms of investigative reporting and in terms of actually under uncovering scandal in terms of actually informing people and rally important issues, these tend to be organizations that are probably going to be fine.",4,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"These are organizations like the new york times, the washington post, boston globe, these are organizations that, sure they're experiencing less money and less returns on money, there going to have to make cuts, but just because something isn't lucrative as it once was doesn't mean that it's still not going to be a workable occupation.",5,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that where the vast majority of the subsidizing is going to go is not towards these more valuable journalistic institutions.,6,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It's going to go more towards like smaller and local journalists.,7,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Things like, like I don't know like, like, channel twelve news from waltham or whatever.",8,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And these are institutions that I don't think are necessarily all that important.,9,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,I don't think that the loss of these is going to be all that important.,10,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"I think that it doesn't, you don't need to have like every single talent or every single you don't have to have every single like, area having its own like, news agencies and things like that.",11,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Most people just don't really watch the local news anymore.,12,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Most people just don't read local newspapers anymore.,13,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It's simply an outdated way of getting your information in an era where you can get both your information on the internet from pretty reliable sources.,14,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"If you actually value looking at the reliability of the sources yourself, you can access this for free, it's much more convenient, it's much better, it's much more aplicable to your individual specific case on what kind of news you want to learn more about.",15,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that propping up this archaic system just isn't something that we should necessarily do / but I also wanna talk about the freedom of speech and freedom of press implications, because I think that this is only going to make an already existing problem worse in the than it is the status quo.",16,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,I already think that a lot of journalists and a lot of like newspapers are unwilling to criticize corporations that do bad things and are unwilling to criticize a lot of corporations because there's a dependency on them.,17,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So like, a clear example of this is that amazon's practices, like the company amazon's practices are probably not going to get critiqued by the washington post anytime soon, because jeff bezos owns both of those things.",18,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"This is the same for a lot of things like if like rupert murdoch owns fox news and the wallstreet journal, any of his other business enterprise are probably not going to get all that criticized.",19,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"You're probably much more likely going to see more pro business coverage, more pro business environments and what this does is this restricts the actual access of information to people in that it restricts or it alters in a lot of ways the content of information that people get.",20,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Now if this would happen to governments, I think this would be even worse.",21,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because you can imagine a situation where the livelihood of people's careers, the livelihoods of journalism and things like that is reliant on federal money.",22,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And if this is the case, you're probably not going to want to piss off the people who are actually giving you this money.",23,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Like the easy example of this would be.,24,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"I think that in a reality in which the like washington post is is like dependent on donald trump for funding, they're probably not going to want to criticize him all that much.",25,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"but I think that this is also just like more broadly applicable because, unlike specific issues, it's more likely to lead to less contentious focuses and things like that.",26,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So, I think that this is going to be very bad because you're going to get less critical journalism, you're going to get less critical engagement with other sides of issues, and I think this is going to reduce the independence of journalism, which is I think one of the biggest things that makes journalism important.",27,,
DJ_2602_journalism_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should not subsidize journalism.",28,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"We should subsidize journalism, because journalism, the process of of purveying this accurate accurate quality information is absolutely vital to a functioning democracy, and such journalism of good quality is dying out.",1,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"So, those are going to be the things I'm going to discuss.",2,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"But first, let's talk a little bit about the model, about what exactly subsidizing journalists going to look like.",3,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"The way in which I foresee this being played out is the government is essentially going to give out grants to am journalist companies, am",4,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"so could be like examples could be something like the sun sentinel in florida am, probably not the washington post or the new york times, maybe",5,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"because I foresee this being used primarily as need based grants for more local industries or state industries that are struggling or struggling meet ends, meet arm more",6,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,That's where I think the money should be going.,7,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"So let's first start by talking about why journalism is dying out, and then talking about why this death is such a big problem, and about why the subsidies are going to be very good and important.",8,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"it's incredibly difficult for journalists, companies to make money these days, and journalists in general to make money these days, and the reason for that is",9,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"because you can access most things on the internet for free, even if you try to, instead of pay, having to pay a subscription, you could still have things like an ad blocker,",10,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"so you can't really profit as a journalist company that way anyway, and it's also often times more convenient for customers and consumers",11,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"because, instead of having to pay a blanket prescription for all subscription for all the content, you can be more selective and only read the things he wants read online",12,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"So, this is obviously particularly bad for local news, and am not nationalist news	in nature.",13,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"But, this presents a very big problem as far as the way in which it's being replaced, and how it does for journalism.",14,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"So, obviously the media and journalism are incredibly important to democracy.",15,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"There's a reason why freedom of press is a protected first amendment right in the US constitution: because, ultimately, everything that's involved in our decisions is reliant on information.",16,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"when we're deciding on conclusions, when we're deciding on our beliefs, all of these things can, all of our values and all the things that we think can only be generated based on the experiences we have in the world, and this this could include both our lived experiences,",17,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,but in a lot of cases this is based on the things that we read or the things that we here about or have as an academic source of discussion or official source of discussion,18,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"So, this is very important because, in order for there for you to have actually truly like educated beliefs, it's necessary for you to be looking at sources that are of good quality.",19,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"Am and that's not good, because when you have traditional journalism, the journalism that is now dying out, it meets this bar in most cases, maybe not fox news, but most cases you have extensive vetting in editing, you have integrity to make sure that it is actually factually true, am, more limited misrepresentation of facts, things like that.",20,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"But, the problem is that when you see the the void, that we see being filled out, is overwhelmingly things like fake news that is being pushed out on facebook, am things like that.",21,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"For example, like hillary clinton has killed like eight people, and was laughing about it afterwards, nonsense like that can get ten million clicks on facebook, because of the way those algorithms work.",22,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,And this is the kind of news it's replacing.,23,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"And it's replacing it effectively, because it's much more sensationalist in nature.",24,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"But, this creates a society in which you're having much less discourse much less founded in fact, so this is how you get such extreme positions on the right wing , positions that are such like unfounded in education or fact, or reality.",25,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"So this is something that's very bad, and this is also particularly bad not just for the national level, based on those kinds of phenomenons I talked about,",26,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,but it also limits engagement with the local level and it makes it,27,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"so that it's harder to have am good and accurate quality news reporting on things that happen on the local level, which is quite bad given that a whole lot of governing that impacts your day to day life happens on a local level",28,,
DJ_2602_journalism_pro.trs.txt,"So, for all those reasons we should subsidize journalism.",29,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,The right to internet access should not be protected because you don't actually have a right to access the internet.,1,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Let's be very clear about what is a right and what isn't a right.,2,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,A right is something that is a very basic and essential part to your existence.,3,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"You have a right to food, you have a right to a to some kind of housing, you have a right to healthcare, you have a right to do things like express your opinions dissent from the government, things like that.",4,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Things that are very basic and elemental parts of fabric of society.,5,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Things that you don't have a right to are things that just make your life easier and that's basically what the internet does.,6,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,In this day and age it's very easy to confuse the internet as something that's essentially a necessity because for most of us the internet is necessary in a lot of ways.,7,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It's necessary because of the fact that we're used to it and it's because the primary means of us communicating and the like.,8,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But at the end of the day the internet is not something that we can't live without.,9,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,The internet is just something that makes our lives easier for things that we already have.,10,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,If we want to communicate with people without the internet there's other options.,11,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"You can use phones, you can talk to people in person there is other ways in which you can communicate with people.",12,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"If you want to have information, books are available, there is public libraries there's all there's there's a lot of alternates to the internet.",13,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,The internet doesn't really provide you with anything unique in that regard.,14,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So I think that the the next thing that's important is looking at this from a opportunity cost, in that it's not a zero sum, in that, like you can just give people their right to internet access and this isn't going to impact anything else,",15,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because the reality is that facilitating a right to internet access isn't cheap,",16,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,because accessing the internet could be something that's like pretty expensive,17,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And the reason for that is because you need to have like a decent amount of infrastructure in place to access the internet.,18,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"like you need to set up like wifi infrastructure across like possibly millions of people, or you need to put like like some kind of cable lines.",19,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,you need to give them.,20,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"like you need to get people like routers, modems.",21,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,you need to give people a device to use.,22,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"you need to make sure that people have options if, like, devices break or something goes wrong.",23,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And all of these things, in order for this to be a right, would have to be covered by the government, and that's, like I think, a problem, because these things are very expensive and, when you think about, it's not like we're perfectly providing for most people's rights, as is.",24,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,it's not like there isn't food insecurity across the world and even in america.,25,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,it's not like people have difficulty accessing affordable housing.,26,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"it's not like people don't get oppressed in other ways, like politically people.",27,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"there's all different kinds of ways in which people's rights get violated in much more important ways, and the most basic one is that, like like you can just like give like people better access to, like educational resources or anything like that.",28,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,like there's a whole different slew of ways in which money could be better spent- limited money better spent than on just trying to facilitate a right to internet access.,29,,
DJ_2604_internet-access_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we shouldn't protect the right to internet access.",30,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,We should not abolish the right to keep and bear firearms because guns can be important for self defense and also sport for some people.,1,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what we would support.,2,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Because abolishing the right to keep and have firearms would would mean that pretty much all guns can be banned and regulated.,3,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that there's a much more reasonable common ground, where you can ban things like automatic and semi automatic weapons, you can ban things like assault rifles.",4,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Our you can also regulate access much more strictly.,5,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"You can have a universal background checks, you can maybe like tax guns, require gun insurance, make like all kinds of restrictions and regulations that are put in place that will I make it so that guns are less likely to fall into the wrong people's hands and that guns are less likely to be abused and they are more likely to be safe.",6,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,But that doesn't mean that guns are all inherently bad.,7,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So there's a couple of things here: so the first of which is that there is a self defense concern that is here.,8,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"Guns are incredibly prominent in america, and regardless of whether or not you legally allow people to have guns, there's already millions and millions of guns that are already in existence.",9,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"So in order to make sure that people are able to protect themselves possibly, able to use self defense, you want at least some people who are trained to have guns besides police officers who may not be able to get there in time.",10,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"Because if there's a civilian has a gun who is being attacked or sees somebody being attacked, then maybe they're able to do something about it.",11,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,That could be like a really good legitimate and valid use for a gun.,12,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So guns can have like they can definitely serve a purpose.,13,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,But beyond that I also think that guns can be useful for sport.,14,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,A whole lot of people compete in things.,15,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like whether it's like rifling or target practice, you just go to a shooting range for the fun of it, or maybe like deer are over populating some area so you're able to hunt some deer, or something like that.",16,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Things that already are legitimate in allowable and happen right now.,17,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"This is like an important thing that some people do, that some people have fun with and that's a choice some people make.",18,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,And it doesn't really hurt anyone.,19,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,It doesn't really hurt anyone that people go to like a shooting range or hunt some overpopulated deer or something like that.,20,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,These are like perfectly legitimate pastimes.,21,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"And in like a liberal society, in a democratic society you should make it so that people are able to like just do what they wanna do.",22,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"But the final thing, the final argument is that this is this right has really important historical roots in a check against in in a check against oppression in a lot of ways.",23,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,The government has like a whole lot of ability to use force and it can do a lot of stuff to you that could necessarily be bad.,24,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"So the ability of people to like keep firearms, keep their own independent sources of power and weaponry, if they need to, and the whatever, can be something that could be useful like for a variety of reasons in the instance that there's oppression.",25,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"This debate isn't just taking place in the united states, it's abolishing rights to have guns wherever these guns may exist it seems.",26,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"So in circumstances where maybe you need it for safety not just from other individuals, but from even state or more organized actors, guns can obviously serve a role and a purpose.",27,,
DJ_2610_arms_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons don't abolish rights to have firearms.,28,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"We should ban homeopathy, because it at the end of the day just hurts people, it hurts people because it discourages real treatment, and it discourages access, or seeking out real treatment in place of fake treatment.",1,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"So, obviously the government should ban them on those grounds.",2,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about that: what is a good standard?",3,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,What should the government be thinking about when it decides if it wants to ban something?,4,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"There's three things that come to mind for me: first, does this hurt people?",5,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"Second, are there any benefits that could possibly counterbalance the fact that this hurts people?",6,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"And third, even if it hurts people, or doesn't help people all that much, is this a choice that people can make accurately and consent into, is there coercion involved, things like that.",7,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,Am homeopathy has problems with all three of these rather basic paradigms.,8,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's go into that a little bit more.",9,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"So first, as far as the harms are concerned, homeopathy obviously has no real scientific value, but it has harms in that it could possibly.",10,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"for example, the treatments they are getting themselves can be harmful.",11,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"you can get more sick as a result of the homeopathic treatment, or at the very least, the homeopathic treatment is happening in absence of scientifically proven treatment, or am actually well tested treatment.",12,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"So, even if the homeopathy itself doesn't make you less healthy, which it might, it certainly isn't going to make you more healthy, which is net loss if you are sick, because if you're unhealthy that means you're just going to be staying unhealthy, and that's obviously a very big harm.",13,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,So homeopathy is bad for that.,14,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"Am, but, additionally there's no benefits to counterbalance this.",15,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"Maybe if homeopathy was proven to work for some people, am in of itself, that would be worth it, but it's not.",16,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"There's been extensive scientific testing on this, and there's no real proof that homeopathy actually helps people, any more than a placebo effect otherwise would.",17,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"So, there's no real reason why we should accept the fact that this does harm people, and we discourage people from getting real treatment.",18,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"But, the final part about this is about can people make this choice, and I think that this is uniquely bad, because if this is true, then you're essentially seeing people getting coerced into picking a treatment that, we know doesn't work, am and why?",19,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"And the reason for this is they think because it's cheaper, fake medicine is usually cheaper than real medicine, real medicine costs money to produce, it costs more money to research and develop, it has to go through more extensive testing, there's reasons why medical care is oftentimes expensive.",20,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"So people may feel, especially if you're financially disadvantaged, you may see this as a viable treatment option, something that could fit your financial needs more so.",21,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"But that's bad, because I think that the focus should be on enabling access for people for real treatment, it to be enabling access to real treatment, rather than am making it so, that people feel pressured into picking fake treatment, ultimately getting sick and dying anyway.",22,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"But don't think that that's obviously something that this would be first choice, I think most people's first choice would be the more accepted in sound medicine, because people want to be healthy, people are going to want to pick those things.",23,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"Am, but the final thing is that people also may be coerced into picking this because it may be easier.",24,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"oftentimes undergoing- whether it's taking possible cocktails of drugs that could impact your mind in a different ways or impact your mood, impact your health or eating habits- am possibly having to undergo something like like chemotherapy can lead to harmful side effects.",25,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,amm oftentimes drugs can't get mixed and mashed together very well.,26,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,there's all kinds of things that can happen.,27,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"There's all kinds of reasons why homeopathic treatment may strike someone as an easier route to go under, and that's something that people want to believe on a very basic level.",28,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,they want to believe that it's going to work.,29,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,but belief in something working doesn't mean that it's actually going to work.,30,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,in the same way that believing global warming is a myth doesn't mean that everyone isn't going to be fucked in a few years.,31,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"So it's very important to recognize this, because this is a perfect scenario for which you should ban something.",32,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"it doesn't help anyone and people can't even reasonably pick if this is right for them, because they're probably going to be pressured or coerced into take taking this because they feel that this is an easier way out of a big problem for them or, even more perniciously, they feel that they can't afford.",33,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"there's no real affordable option for alternatives, so they see this as cheaper.",34,,
DJ_2615_homeopathy_pro.trs.txt,"That's not very good, you need to have better options for people, and in light of that you should ban homeopathy",35,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,We should ban alternative medicine for two big reasons.,1,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"First, because it hurts people directly and second, because it creates an opportunity cost for funding and focus on real medication.",2,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"So first, why should we ban alternative medicine?",3,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,It creates very clear and obvious direct harms towards the people it hurts.,4,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"Now, I think it's a generally accepted idea that the government should ban things that are harmful to people.",5,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"Obviously, the government bans things like heroin.",6,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,It bans a lot of non-FDA approved drugs.,7,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"It bans a whole lot of other things as well, and it bans these things because we believe that the government has a duty to protect its people from things that could be that they could be coerced into taking that could be harmful.",8,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,So why is this true?,9,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,Because the population aren't medical experts.,10,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"The population isn't able to fully understand what any given medical compound is going to do to them, and it is therefore very easy for them to be misled into taking things that could be harmful for them, without fully understanding the consequences, and that's obviously not good.",11,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"But another reason why they could be misled into taking these kinds of things is because and to alternative medicine, more specifically, is because there is a hope element to this.",12,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"Oftentimes if you're you could be taking an alternative medicine, it could be im they could have less side effects than conventional medicine, it could be cheaper, it could be more enjoyable, it could be a whole lot of other things as well.",13,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,So that's another reason why people may be led into taking alternative medicine.,14,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"So, obviously this isn't very good because at the very best, alternate medicines have no proven record at all of efficacy.",15,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"So they're not actually doing anything for you, you're just wasting your money on it.",16,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,But the worst case is that some alternative medicines could be very bad.,17,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"They could react poorly with conventional treatments, they could do harm to you on their very own inherently, and this is very bad.",18,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"And this is very bad, especially not just because it's bad, but also because there's no benefits accrued as a point of comparison.",19,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,So there's no even real reason why this is necessary to take or benefits.,20,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,Any benefits cannot actually be isolated to alternative medicine itself.,21,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"So, now that we've established that, next going to talk about the opportunity cost point.",22,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"So, this is also very important because all of the billions of dollars that get invested into researching and ultimately disproving anything beneficial about alternative medicine comes at a cost first and because it takes a long time to confirm these kinds of things.",23,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"So first and foremost, if the government is funding research and on alternative medicine, it's not funding research on real medicine.",24,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"And this is a big problem because the development of actual drugs, drugs that save people's lives, can be an incredibly expensive and incredibly long process, and increase funding for this kind increase this process, make it quicker, and this could result in a whole bunch of lives being saved if a cure or if or a more effective treatment is even found a few months earlier.",25,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,But the second thing is that all of this money being spent on alternative medicine additionally also is money that cannot be spent on facilitating access to conventional medicine networks.,26,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"So rather than spending billions of dollars on researching and proving that these stupid medicines don't work anyway, what they can do is they can spend all of this money on making it so that existing health care that we know works is more affordable and accessible.",27,,
DJ_2616_alternative-medicine_pro.trs.txt,"So if we want to ensure that there is a healthier population, one that's going to be more productive and more financially capable and also just, in general, better off population, I think it's very clear that we should ban alternative medicine.",28,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,National service should not be mandatory in the united states because it is both incredibly rights violative and it would also be bad for the civil service or public service apparatus in the in the united states anyway.,1,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So first, why is it incredibly rights violative?",2,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Keep in mind that there's only so much that we owe the state in the first place.,3,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"The state gives us certain services, it establishes things like fire departments, police departments, it regulates roads, it regulates a court system and things like this.",4,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And these are all things that are designed to make our lives easier, safer and better in other various ways.",5,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,But here's the thing: we pay for those services.,6,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"That's why, like for a lot of people, you can see like twenty five percent of your paycheck going to like the federal government.",7,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,another dozen or so could be going to the state government.,8,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,you are also probably paying a greater or like a like a separate tax into like healthcare apparatuses and things like this.,9,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"you also are probably paying fines in like fees for a lot of other government services as well for using them, like, say, highways.",10,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,you pay for like tolls and things like this.,11,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So it's not like people are using government services for free right now.,12,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"By and large, if there's some kind of problem of like, so here's the next thing: the thing is that there's no obligation beyond like paying what you get from the government, like paying for what you use of the governments.",13,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,There's no obligation to the nation itself.,14,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"There is no obligation that like I have to like use my body or give up years of my life in service of the country, just because it's the one that happen to live in.",15,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Because let's face it.,16,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,That country hasn't necessarily done anything that's worthy of it.,17,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And if people choose to give back, if people choose to go into public service then that's their choice, but there's nothing that like the united states has done that makes it so that it deserves like several years of my life, in service to it, certainly not certainly not a lot of like certain or like bad parts of the US government.",18,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And that's the next thing in that this can be like really rights violative because you don't really have any choice in the matter, in that it's really hard, it's like: national service is mandatory.",19,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"You really can't say no you can't opt out of this because the threat of this is probably going to be fines, imprisonment, the state can force you to do it essentially and that's bad because.",20,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Besides that, it's incredibly political.",21,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"It's an incredibly political act to work for the government, especially if the government is like assigning you to various places or like ordering you to do certain things in the federal government.",22,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So like they could order you do something in military service or to assist the military, they could order you to maybe be like an administrative assistant to like the like immigrations and customs enforcement, which I think is immoral.",23,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,They can force you to do all kinds of things and that's certainly not right.,24,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,It's not right that they can take out your voice limit your life and control your control your life and your limit your freedom in that kind of a way.,25,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,But I also think that it's bad,26,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"because it's gonna be bad for national service in that, rather than incentivizing a lifelong service or longer term service at least, it's now going to be filled by people who are only there",27,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"because they're being forced to be there, people who aren't really going to enjoy it that much, people who aren't going to like their job, people who aren't going to get all that much meaning from their jobs and, as soon as the term expires, people who are probably going to leave those jobs",28,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe some people are going to like it, some people are going to stay, a lot of those people probably would have ended up doing it anyway.",29,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So, the result is you're probably going to replace maybe a smaller group of lifelong public servants with a bigger group of people who are going to be less experienced, less happy and less willing to actually do the jobs that are required of them.",30,,
DJ_2622_national-service_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons don't institute mandatory national service in the united states.,31,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not ban strip clubs because there's really nothing wrong with strip clubs.,1,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"There's nothing wrong with going to a strip club, and there's nothing wrong with working at a strip club either.",2,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So let's start by talking about why there really isn't any harm, obviously, in just going to a strip club and having fun for a night.",3,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that that's really the core of it.,4,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Nobody really gets hurt when you're talking about just going to a strip club.,5,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,People choose to work in these places and they're just places where you go to have a good time.,6,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe you go with some friends, you go before like somebody's wedding, or just because like somebody broke up with their significant other and you wanna like blow off some steam or whatever, or for whatever reason.",7,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"It's something that people do, it doesn't hurt anyone, and people should be able to enjoy their life, make choices about how they enjoy their life the way they want to.",8,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And if people find it like enjoyable to have somebody like grind on top of them dance on top of them in like scantily clad close, which like a lot of people find that like to be reasonably enjoyable, then you should be able to do that.",9,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"It's not a really, it's not really a big deal.",10,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But the other thing is that like you should definitely obviously be allowed to work as a stripper if you want to.,11,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And this is like a very clear things.,12,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So you should have the right to do what you want with your body.,13,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like your body, if there's anything that you have ownership over, if there is anything that like you ought have like control over, its your literal body.",14,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It's like an incredibly important thing to you.,15,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And beyond that, beyond just having the right to have control over your body and what you should be able to do with your body, another thing that's reasonably acceptable that you should be able to do which is generally accepted a lot of western liberal democracies is that you should be able to do what you want with your life as far as career choices are concerned.",16,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,You can choose to be a lawyer or a doctor or a firefighter or a police officer and there's really nothing wrong with being a stripper.,17,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,There's nothing wrong with working as a at a strip club.,18,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And you should be able to do that if you want to make money that way.,19,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"A lot of the people who work in strip clubs are younger people, often relying on it for supplemental income or some kind of income, maybe while they're in classes or in between jobs or something like that.",20,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And if you're like, if you're hot enough to work at a strip club then like good for you.",21,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Get supplemental income that way.,22,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,You shouldn't have your career choices arbitrarily restricted like that.,23,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like, people like me who are hot enough to work at a strip club, get supplemental income from giving IBM speeches.",24,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But a lot of people wouldn't get paid to give debate speeches.,25,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So they should be able to make money in other ways.,26,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Just how I could make supplemental income my way to help pay my bills.,27,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It's really like an unfair standard.,28,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"In a lot of ways almost like targeting people's sexuality and like targeting people's bodies and like trying to almost shame people away from displaying their bodies or taking or using their bodies to make money, which is absolutely ridiculous.",29,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like using your body to make money is only different, in terms of like weird people's weird moral frameworks, any different than using your mind to make money.",30,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because at the end of the day you're just using a part of your body, whether it's your brain or your body, and you're going to make money that way.",31,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,That's like: good for you.,32,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,You should do what you want to do.,33,,
DJ_2656_strip-clubs_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons don't then strip clubs.,34,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,We should abolish the right to remain silent because it doesn't actually need to exist as a right in order to protect the dignity of people and the safety of people.,1,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"So let's start with a little bit of background here, because I think that help ground discussion that we're having here.",2,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"Things like miranda warning came about in miranda v.
Arizona during the civil rights era, because police officers were essentially compelling testimony, and they were doing so in ways like whether it was by beatings or intimidation or deprivation of sleep or other kinds of things like that, so that people were compelled to testify.",3,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,So that's why the right to create to remain silent was instituted in its more or less current form.,4,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,But I think that this is distinct from the right to like self incrimination in a lot of ways.,5,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,So I think that the first and foremost thing to note is that we compel testimony all the time.,6,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"Whether it's in the form of a subpoena, so like for example right now bob muller, in the investigation of light trump in russia, is subpoenaing people left and right and is able to compel all kinds of testimony.",7,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"And in fact, if you lie or you give an incomplete answer, it's perjury and that's an additional crime.",8,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,So the first thing to note is that we compel testimony in a lot of other kinds of scenarios and it works out just fine.,9,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,But the next thing that's worth pointing out is that most rights are not blanket rights in the way that self incrimination is.,10,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"In fact, self incrimination isn't even a blanket right itself.",11,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"So if you want to search so if you want to search somebody's house, for example, oftentimes you need a search warrant to do that.",12,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"But you don't always need a search warrant, and that doesn't necessarily mean that you can't use evidence that you find if you don't get a search warrant.",13,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"So for example if you think that the evidence may get destroyed, if it's an active pursuit by the police, if there's a threat to like some kind of person, there's all kinds of exceptions to that kind of rule.",14,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,Similarly we also exceptions to the right to self incrimination.,15,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"In american law for example, things like excited utterances or like statements made by this like , like excited utterances by people, statements that could be made by maybe a deceased person so they can't testify on their own, like there's all kinds of other kinds of things that you can use.",16,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,But additionally I also think that it's not necessary to have a blanket ban in against against incriminating testimony in order to make sure that you can protect people's rights.,17,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,You can just regulate the ability of of how police conduct investigations.,18,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"So make sure that police aren't like torturing people, make sure police aren't beating people, make sure that there's no compelled testimony.",19,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,Because it's true.,20,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,Compelled testimony can be invalid testimony.,21,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,And the reason why we have the right to remain silent is because we don't want to compel like inaccurate or incorrect testimony.,22,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,But we definitely want to be striving for as much information as possible if we want to have the court system be as accurate as fair as possible.,23,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,So there really isn't any reason why we need to have this kind of a blanket ban in place.,24,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"I think that we would have a better court system with more accurate information if we got rid of the right to remain silent, and we just made sure that that other kinds of things were being other rights were being respected.",25,,
DJ_2657_right-to-silence_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should get rid of the right to remain silent.",26,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,We should subsidize massive open online courses because it is an incredibly effective way to increase access to college to a college education to affordable education and oftentimes the quality of these courses can be pretty good especially if you subsidize them and you devote more resources to them.,1,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what the problems are right now.,2,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,Right now college is incredibly expensive.,3,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,You could end up paying tens and tens of thousands of dollars taking on loans most likely because you don't have much of a credit history.,4,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,Most people don't have much of a credit history when they're like an underage person.,5,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,You're probably going to be and you're really in a coercive situation when you're taking on loans.,6,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,By and large you tend to be taking on massive massive amounts of debt with very high average interest rates that can put you in a really bad position when you're going to college.,7,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,Oftentimes a lot of people aren't even able to go to college in the first place because of those reasons.,8,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,"Maybe it's because they have to work a full time job, maybe it's because they have to support a family, maybe because they're not even able to get a loan because their parents had poor credit, maybe they came from a poor background or maybe people only people struggled in certain kinds of classes and their GPA's weren't high enough even if they had other kinds of skills.",9,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,So there's all kinds of reasons why but traditional college like traditional colleges aren't always open to everybody like financially and even finances aside.,10,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,So I think as an alternative obviously open online courses can be a great correction for this.,11,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,Open online courses can be subsidized to the extent in which they're incredibly cheap if not like outright free possibly.,12,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,"Furthermore, a lot of these courses can be taken at your own at your own pace.",13,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,"So if you have to work during the day, you can take them at night, or if you're working long hours, you can just do it when you have time, and it's a way in which it allows you to better manager academic schedule in a way in which is conducive to your individual lifestyle, which can make it",14,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,"so that you're able to learn much more effectively, and that's obviously a good thing",15,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,So beyond that I also think that these open online courses can be an incredibly effective way of learning.,16,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,"When you think about it all you're really getting out of traditional college experience is you're talking to your classmates, you're talking to professors, you're reading some stuff, you're writing some stuff, you're doing some kinds of you're doing some like maybe some community service on the side, but most of these things aren't like intrinsically like required like you don't have to do them at a college.",17,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,There are things that you often happen to do given the atmosphere of a college and the structure of a college but you don't have to do them at a college.,18,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,You don't have to go to college to read academic papers.,19,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,You don't have to go to college to talk professors if they're willing to email you as a part of an online course.,20,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,You don't have to talk to your classmates face to face if you're able to converse with them via digital means.,21,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,You don't have to buy like text books in like hard copies.,22,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,You can just like read digital PDF's and things like that.,23,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,There's all kinds of ways in which the digital world can function as replacement digital education and it can function as quite an effective replacement because it can fulfill a lot of the same functions.,24,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,So I really don't think that there is a whole lot of problems as for why we can't have massive online courses as an effective solution to essentially a crisis in affordable college.,25,,
DJ_2665_online-courses_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should subsidize online courses.",26,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,We should subsidize distance education because it ensures more access to education and that's incredibly important.,1,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,So the first way in which it ensures more access is just by making the literal act of going to school a whole lot easier which is great.,2,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,It makes it a whole lot easier because first right now there's oftentimes a real concentration of schools in specific locations that may not be accessible for a whole lot of people.,3,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,Like let's say that you live in a developing country you're probably not going to be able to go to some college in the united states and maybe it's not possible for you to go to the couple of colleges that exist in like a big cities or things like that.,4,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,Additionally but it's oftentimes easier to get access it's oftentimes pretty comparatively easy to get access to say the internet.,5,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,But this is even true in other kinds of contexts like for example schools tend to concentrate in america a most of the elite schools tend to concentrate in the like northeast area.,6,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,So it's increased costs of going to college there if you don't already live near the area.,7,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,Additionally there's a time problem.,8,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,A lot of people have jobs a lot of people have other kinds of obligations maybe people have to take care of family members and they can't really leave home there's a whole other kind there's a whole slew of reasons why people may not have the time to get involved in a traditional education setting.,9,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,Maybe not even go consistently to night school.,10,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,Distance learning allows you to learn at your own pace oftentimes it allows you to learn in a more customized fashion which is incredibly good.,11,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,But it also increases access in terms of money in terms of financial costs and this is obvious.,12,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,You can spend tens of thousands of dollars on tuition in a ton of colleges a lot of this ends up happening going to student loans which is pretty bad for a whole lot of people.,13,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,A lot of people may not have the credit to afford it to get access to student loans.,14,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,A lot of people may not be able to afford the interest rates.,15,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,A lot of people don't think they're going to realistically make enough money post graduation to pay off student loans.,16,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,A lot of people are just freaked out of the about the idea of borrowing like tens and tens of thousands of dollars before they even start their life off.,17,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,Those are pretty reasonable things and reasons why it ultimately discourages people from getting an education.,18,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,And ultimately that's the worst outcome and it's the worst outcome because a less less education means that you're probably going to have lower career earnings it means that the workforce is less educated and your workers are less skilled.,19,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,There's less innovation and creation.,20,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,There's less economic growth there's a whole lot of reasons why you want to encourage economic why you want to encourage education.,21,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,But additionally distance learning is also something that can be uniquely helped by subsidies.,22,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,And it can be helped by subsidies because right now there's already a a large like demand that's being met for traditional colleges like there's no real shortage of traditional colleges.,23,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,But there is a real shortage of quality alternative options.,24,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,Obviously there's some alternate in the status quo like there's coursera there's like harvard open course and things like that.,25,,
DJ_2678_distance-education_pro.trs.txt,But these things are oftentimes limited and they're going to stay limited because there's less of a demand for them and less economies of scale for them and all these things can be corrected if you have more subsidies so for all those reasons you should subsidize distance education.,26,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,We should eliminate unesco because unesco is a waste of money and its mission itself isn't really a necessary one.,1,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why unesco is a waste of money.,2,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,And it's important to recognize that the united the united nations does a lot of important work in the world.,3,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,Whether it's like the UN human rights program or UN programs focused on poverty poverty reduction and international aid and things like that.,4,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,There's a good deal of work that the UN does in the world in in form of helping people's lives.,5,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,And that's a big reason why we don't need unesco.,6,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,Because all of those things that the UN does are more important than unesco.,7,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,"So for starters I think that there's necessarily this is, this is like pretty obvious.",8,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,"Obviously you should prioritize like feeding people who are dying of starvation, or helping people cure like diseases or prevent diseases through like education and like infrastructure to combat disease and things like that.",9,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,Those kinds of things are like clearly more important than like facilitating cultural exchange or like university research or things like that.,10,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,First and foremost because I think that those things are more urgent.,11,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,"If people are like like need like food to survive that's probably more important than like like other kinds of issues, cultural issues, even if those things aren't necessarily like bad things, and secondarily because I think the money is necessarily finite.",12,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,And a big reason for that is because governments are only willing to give so much money to the UN.,13,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,The UN only has so much money to spend.,14,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,So all of the money that it can spend that it does spend with unesco is money it's not spending on other kinds of programs that could better help people.,15,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,"But the next thing, and the big reason why we should eliminate unesco is that a lot of it is redundant.",16,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,There's dozens of academic programs all around the world that facilitate research and exchange.,17,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,Like private universities are all the time facilitating research and exchange.,18,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,"Professors go to other, like professors go on sabbaticals, professors go on exchange programs, students go on exchange programs.",19,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,There's a like a whole slew of international and regional organizations designed to facilitate the expansion and exchange of knowledge.,20,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,So the so you unesco doesn't really do anything particularly unique in that regard.,21,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,Because all of the things that it does do are things that other organizations can do just as well.,22,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,So in a lot of ways it's just an incredibly redundant organization.,23,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,"But additionally, other parts of its mission, like expanding global understandings of justice, or expanding things like human rights or things like that are even more redundant.",24,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,Like you literally have the united nations human rights program.,25,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,"So if you have like a literal program that is designed to actually deal with those kinds of things, I don't know why you would need to have a redundant thing.",26,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,"And beyond that, a lot of these things are oftentimes also also times like western like western focused in a really problematic way.",27,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,"Because oftentimes what culture should be looking like, what is important in a culture, what is important to preserve or non preserve, what an ideal of justice is or isn't, all of those things are oftentimes, a lot of those can be relative based on your culture.",28,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that it should be something that's necessarily left up to an international organization then, but should be more left to regional governments to operate in in how they see fit.",29,,
DJ_2679_unesco_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should get rid of unesco.,30,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We should subsidize single parents because single parents are often in incredibly bad situations through no fault of their own and they deserve our sympathy and our support.,1,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So I want to start by talking about why single parents are often in the situation that they're in.,2,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,By and large it's accidental pregnancies amongst people who aren't ready to have children and that could be for a variety of reasons.,3,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"It could maybe be that they didn't have access to birth control because of financial reasons, it could have been that their family prevented them from getting access to birth control, or for religious reasons.",4,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"The same could be true of something like an abortion in a lot of parts of the world especially in certain places in america getting an abortion can be prohibitive, it can be expensive, it can be incredibly far away, it can be there could be a huge amount of legal restrictions that make it difficult logistically to get an abortion.",5,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Oftentimes people don't want to stay together to support a child because maybe people had sex for fun but they weren't ready for a baby which is something that happens literally all the time.,6,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,There's all kinds of reasons why people can be single parents and that's important because the common thread is that people don't usually do this by choice.,7,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It's something that is an accident and they're probably in that situation because of the way society's structured and the way society privileges certain people that makes it more likely that some people are going to be single parents than others given resource disparities.,8,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So given all that's true, why does it just makes sense to subsidize single parents on a moral level and a practical level?",9,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Obviously it makes sense to subsidize parents because having to support a family if you're not ready for that is hugely burdensome.,10,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"It can make it harder for you to hold down a job, it can make it harder for you to do all kinds of things, and it's also a drain on your resources as well so obviously as a parent it can be incredibly difficult for you.",11,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But we want to make sure that we're supporting kids as well.,12,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"If there is anyone who really has no fault of where they're born, it's like it's kids.",13,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,kids don't have control over where they're born.,14,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"it's not their fault if their parents, if they grew up in a loving household with like every kind of privilege imaginable, or with",15,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"two parents with a lot of money, or if it's a household where you have",16,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,one person who's trying as hard as they can to support their family,17,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but simply can't do it, and it could lead to maybe children going hungry or not be able to get access to healthcare, things like that",18,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,You want to make sure that kids are getting taken care and that's why you need to make sure that you have subsidies there as well.,19,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But finally it's good for society.,20,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,You want to make sure that you have people who grow up,21,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because, like, there's all kinds of things- whether it's like possibly getting seduced to join a gang",22,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because you don't see career prospects going anywhere,",23,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,because or maybe you're desperate for more money,24,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because you need to put food on the table, or something like that- or maybe it's just",25,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because there's, like a lot of really intelligent people who don't get access to the same kinds of like schooling as other people, who may not have the money to afford like a certain like education or other kinds of activities",26,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,they simply get left behind in society.,27,,
DJ_2723_single-parents_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons it just makes sense for everybody if we subsidize single parents.,28,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not ban breast implants because people should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, for the most part, particularly in this case and there's a lot of legitimate reasons why people may want to get breast implants whether it's just because they want to change the way they look so they feel better or maybe their industry requires it.",1,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about bodily autonomy because I think that that's what is at the heart of this debate.,2,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And this is incredibly important,3,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because, in general, you should be able to do what you want with your body,",4,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because if there's anything that we should have ownership over, if there is anything that we should have control over, it's being able to make decisions about what we do with our bodies and how we should look,",5,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because, in a lot of ways, it's the most important way that we have forms of expression",6,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So in the same way that you have a freedom of speech you're allowed to say you don't like the government for whatever reason you want you're able to express yourself in that way.,7,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Oftentimes your body is a form of expression too.,8,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"sometimes it can be political expression if you get, say, a tattoo that says like fuck the draft, or something like that because you wanted to protest, maybe a military draft, or or like a peace symbol to protest like going against war or something like that, like there's all kinds of ways in which, obviously, you can use your body for an explicitly political message.",9,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but that's obviously not the limit to which expression should be protected, because cultural expression, expression of our interests, are all ways in which we express aspects of our being and aspects of our personality to other people in society and, in a lot of ways, as the basis of which we engage with other people in society.",10,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"and it's also really important to us, because what's identifies us as individual peoples as opposed to just being like a faceless mass of bodies, the choices we make, how we look, how we dress- all these things are part of our being and how we express ourselves.",11,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So given all of that, I think that there should be a deep degree of skepticism when we just outright ban something that about regulations on what people can do with their body.",12,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that this should be limited to cases where like there's like a really really clear harm that this could have on like other people and I definitely don't think that breast implants do that.,13,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,They don't really hurt anybody.,14,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,they just kind of change the way that you look.,15,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,it may not be necessary.,16,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"for the most part you don't really need a breast, breast implants if you're going to get them, but it's definitely not something that really hurts anybody and it only affects you in any way.",17,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"so we definitely think that people, you should defer to the individual choices that people make.",18,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But, beyond that I also think there's incredibly legitimate reasons that people may have to get breast implants.",19,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So like if you have breast, breast cancer- and you get a mastectomy, then you may not have breasts anymore and that could be something that you feel really uncomfortable about and you don't want.",20,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,maybe a disease that you have to dictate the way that you look in.,21,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"like the same way that if somebody gets cancer and undergoes chemo and they go bald, we're not going to ban people from like getting wigs so they can look like they have hair, if that makes people more comfortable after they've gone through like a really a really difficult time in their lives.",22,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"In a lot of ways that could be something that like breast cancer survivors may be comfortable with,not everyone's going to want to do that but it's certainly reasonable if some people want to do that.",23,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But additionally, there's also obviously industries where getting a breast implant can maybe be helpful for you financially.",24,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,there's no reason why people shouldn't be able to make money off their bodies and make money off the way they look if tha's want to do so.,25,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,we don't bat an eye when people make money off their brains or when people make money off their bodies in terms of sports.,26,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,people should be able to do it based off their attractiveness too.,27,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"so if you work in porn, if you're a model or in some other kind of industry, maybe acting, it may just make sense for you to get a breast implant.",28,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,it could be good for your business.,29,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,it could make you more comfortable and confident.,30,,
DJ_2735_breast-implants_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons don't ban breast implants.,31,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,We should ban telemarking because telemarketing is spam and it's an invasion of privacy.,1,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why it's just something that's really annoying and banning annoying things is a perfectly reasonable thing to do.,2,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,So obviously telemarketing is is annoying.,3,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,Oftentimes it's not even a person calling you it's just some robot and it makes it so that you probably want to pick up the phone because it could be something important not everyone is able to leave a message it could be an emergency and you shouldn't have to assume that you're you shouldn't have to assume that the person who's calling your personal phone is spam.,4,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,You shouldn't assume that it's just some nonsense thing or some kind of scam or like a random marketing thing.,5,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,You should be able to assume with like good faith that if somebody's calling you on your personal phone it's something that's important.,6,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,So whenever you get telemarketing calls it's incredibly important.,7,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,So being annoying is perfectly reasonable grounds to ban something.,8,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,We ban public nuisances all the time.,9,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"like if somebody is like having like a party or something like that that's too loud and the neighbor complains about it, the police can tell them to quiet down.",10,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"if, like, somebody is like littering, that's like a nuisance or something like that, like there's all kinds of nuisance crimes that people get in trouble for that you can have be punishable.",11,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"so I think that this is definitely something that in in a lot of ways, telemarketing is far more annoying than a lot of those things.",12,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"I really can't think of anyone who particularly likes telemarketing, who is responsive to telemarketing.",13,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,the only reason it probably even exists is because it's like one of the.,14,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"it's a very low cost, just kind of have a machine on a recorder randomly call a bunch of numbers from a phone book.",15,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,So that brings us into the second problem which is that this is an invasion of privacy in the sense that our like public phone numbers shouldn't just be available for corporations and businesses like just to call whenever they feel like it trying to sell their product.,16,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"It's absolutely ridiculous because it's your personal phone and your personal phone should be your space to communicate with people who, like you need to communitcate with.",17,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,it shouldn't be something that you need to like constantly be worrying about and like filtering through of.,18,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"if I pick up this phone, is it just going to be some annoying telemarketing thing?",19,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"and it's ridiculous that, like, corporations and businesses can just like have personal information about you, like your phone number, whenever they feel like getting it just from public databases.",20,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,they don't want to have any good reason just because they want to sell you something like it's an absolutely horrible reason to do that.,21,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"You shouldn't be able to just take personal information like that and do things like that, like if you were constantly getting like, like in the same way the like constantly getting spam mailed your address is super annoying and you don't want, like random businesses knowing your address.",22,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"besides the fact that it's a security hazard, because if that business knows your address, then everyone at that business knows your address.",23,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"and while we're thinking about that, every business in the world that has access to like a, like a phone book knows, like this information about you.",24,,
DJ_2747_telemarketing_pro.trs.txt,"so for all those reasons, you should ban telemarketing.",25,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,We should ban piercings and tattoos for minors.,1,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,So for starters I wanna talk by just explaining the basis in a lot of ways for giving minors different treatment than adults.,2,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,Because obviously this is a pretty common practice.,3,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,Minors regularly experience different and varying rights from full adults.,4,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,"Full adults have the right to vote, they pay taxes, minors have a different criminal justice system, they have more restrictions on the way they can work in like labor laws, they have restrictions on like objects that they can consume like tobacco and marijuana.",5,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,So I think in a lot of ways it's the basis for this is because we recognize that minors are still emotionally and physically developing as people.,6,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,"So a lot of things that affect them can affect them and more extreme ways and for longer periods of time and moreover, the basis of which people are making decisions on can fundamentally be less rational and less reasonable because people are just less mature.",7,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,And that's important because I think that one of the biggest reasons the government is justified in making restrictions on its people is because people may just not be in a position to make the a really like a truly reasonable decision.,8,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,"So now that that's been established, let's talk about what are the actual like ground specifically in which you could ban, you should ban piercings and tattoos.",9,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,And I think a lot of ways it's similar to why you don't want to why you do ban alcohol for drinking things like alcohol.,10,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,Because it's important point out that like tattoos and piercings can sometimes be harmful in a lot of ways.,11,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,"You can get infections from these kinds of things, the procedures are oftentimes incredibly painful to undergo, so there's like definitely problems associated with.",12,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,In a lot of ways it can at times be more extreme than alcohol.,13,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,"Like obviously alcohol carries more of a risk, you're probably not going to die from getting a tattoo, although depending on what the infection is maybe you could, but in the same way a lot of things like are less extreme.",14,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,Like tobacco on each individual instance is probably like less painful and less destructive than getting like a piercing or a tattoo maybe.,15,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,It's only in like the totality of like many times of using tobacco or many times of drinking alcohol that it becomes more harmful.,16,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,So I think that we should like ignore any kind of like argumentation to the contrary that piercings and tattoos can have some kind of adverse impact on kids.,17,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,"So given that, what are the reasons why this could be like amplified even further?",18,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that the fact that a lot of the things are permanent, maybe not so much the pain that you get at the time of the piercing or the tattoo or maybe not even the infection, but the way in which your body is fundamentally changed forever, your body is going to look different for ever, is is like a very permanent aspect.",19,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,So it's a choice that people are making that isn't an easily reversible one.,20,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,So that's like more grounds for legitimacy for regulating it.,21,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,But moreover I also think that an outright ban is a good way to make sure that parents or other teenagers or other people in these kids lives aren't inappropriately pressuring people to make this kind of a permanent decision.,22,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,"Because I think that a lot of cases, whether it's maybe like your parents have this piercing and they want you to have it too for some kind of cultural reasons, or an older friend of yours got it and now you want to get it, or like an older brother or sister or something like that.",23,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,It's important to recognize that these can have like long term impacts so you want to be like you want to be like risk averse in how this is happening.,24,,
DJ_2761_piercing-and-tattoos_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons ban minors from tattoos and piercings.,25,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,We should raise corporate taxes and the biggest reason why we should raise corporate taxes is because corporations have way too much money.,1,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,Corporations have so much money that I honestly truly believe that they're really not going to miss all that much of the money when you tax them higher.,2,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"When you look at the profit margins that a ton of corporations are running, they're usually quite large profit margins.",3,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"Especially when you're talking about the basic way in which we tax people, tends to be a progressive tax system, the bigger the corporation, the wealthier the corporation is, the more it should be taxed.",4,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So when we're talking about the ability to generate revenue, it's probably going to mostly be proportional to the ability of a corporation to actually pay that.",5,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,And that's a big deal because right now there's a ton of corporations that are profiting billions and billions of dollars in in earnings.,6,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,Billions and billions of dollars that can ultimately be used for a whole lot of greater things.,7,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"And that's really important because when you think about the reasons why I think corporations have like a basic moral obligation to pay this money, there's a couple of things there: first and foremost the reason why the corporations are able to make this money in the first place is because of the government.",8,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,And they should therefore be funding the government more adequately.,9,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"Governments make sure that there is governments first and foremost protect the property in the first place, they use courts, they have a court system to arbitrate disputes, they create various kinds of like other kinds of avenues that make it easier for you to get your products out there, all kinds of things that the government does to actively help corporations.",10,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"But beyond that, it's also just kind of a basic comparison of people who have something verses or or I guess an entity that has something verses an entity that doesn't have a whole that much.",11,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,There's a whole lot of need in places like america for more money.,12,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"More money to spend on infrastructure, healthcare, education, all these kinds of things.",13,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,And corporations simply have the money to spend on these kinds of really good public things.,14,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,So it's kind of a basic intuitive moral thing.,15,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"Help people in need, especially if you have a ton of money and you can afford to do that.",16,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,But I also think that this is especially important given what the alternative of what that money is used for.,17,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"Because I think that there's this really ridiculous , there's this really ridiculous argument that the other side often makes, republicans often make, is that "" oh, well if you tax corporations too much they're just going to shift jobs.",18,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"They're just going to invest less, hire less "".",19,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,And I think that a lot of these things are ridiculous.,20,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"Because when you talk about most corporations, most corporations park a ton of their assets and don't even do a whole lot with it.",21,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,Like you talk about big corporations.,22,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,You talk about things like apple that was at one point sitting on more money than the US government was at the height of like like a debt crisis.,23,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,You talk about like multi billion dollar corporations that keep revenues essentially as like rainy day funds that they never really need.,24,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"You talk about corporations that just kind of like my keep this kind of money around and don't ultimately do that much, or just loan that money to other corporations and don't ultimately generate a whole lot of economic good.",25,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,I think that by and large it can be a whole lot better when you look at what the alternative of that money being used for.,26,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"Rather than just corporation parking their money, parking their assets in a bank or another investor and leading to like a cyclical economic growth for only people at the very top, now you could actually fuel consumption, because you can rebuild because you can make sure that people have lower healthcare burden costs or people don't have to pay as much for student loans, for education costs.",27,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"And those could be all things that are going to increase discretionary funding, which is probably good for corporations anyway.",28,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"You can also do things like invest more in a crumbling infrastructure, which is also good for corporations because it makes it more it makes products more easily accessible across different markets.",29,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So I think this is definitely good for the economy as a whole, it's probably good for corporations too.",30,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"But none of that, even if none of that is true, it's just an obvious moral thing to do.",31,,
DJ_3052_corporate-tax_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, tax corporations more.",32,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not subsidize student loans because subsidizing student loans only masks the problems that exist in public in higher education.,1,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It doesn't really actually solve anything in a meaningful way.,2,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by describing what the actual problem is.,3,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And the problem is that it costs far far too much to get a college education nowadays.,4,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Especially in places like america, where you can spend tens of thousands of dollars a year.",5,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Actually, way more than that.",6,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,You could probably be spending closer to forty thousand dollars a year on tuition at a lot of institutions in america.,7,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Which is way way too much money.,8,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And it's an impossible burden for people to take on.,9,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So it may sound nice, it may sound appealing to subsidize student loans that people are taking on but let's break down what these subsidies are actually probably going to look like.",10,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"In reality, probably not all that much.",11,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It's going to be like a mild subsidy.,12,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"At most, maybe it'll pay for like a fraction of what you're actually taking on debt wise.",13,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And beyond that, you're already taking on.",14,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"The fact that like your student loan it's going to get subsidized, even if they subsidized half of your fucking student loan, you could still be taking on tens of thousands of dollars of debt.",15,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And because you're in a predatory situation where your career prospects are severely limited without a college degree, sallie mae or similar like private loan actors can charge whatever they want as far as interest wage is concerned so you could see double digit interest rates on your loan as like as far as what you would have to pay back.",16,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So I really don't see how much of the meaningful difference this is going to make.,17,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It's only going to mask the problem.,18,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because people are still going to graduate with way too much debt, people are still going to have like like the student debt crisis is going to go anywhere.",19,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And beyond that, beyond the fact that this isn't going to help the fact that people are taking on too much debt, this isn't going to help change the fact that private loan providers can be incredibly predatory in their practices.",20,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And it creates this illusion of solvency that: "" oh, well if you're going to be like if you're going to be helping people pay for it already then it doesn't matter if like these private businesses get to make their money however they want. """,21,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that like the political will that's at stake as far as actually regulating these people as a whole lot worse.,22,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And moreover, I also think that there is less likely going to be political will for people to do it too because there's going to be intense lobbying in politics by the people who make their billions and not and probably like billions and hundreds of billions of dollars off of the backs of students who can't afford to make these payments oftentimes anyway.",23,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So all that is bad.,24,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But the final thing that I want to talk about is what this is going to come as the sacrifice of.,25,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Because we already don't see enough government subsidies for things like aid and grants and things like that.,26,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Which are which are targeted towards the most needy people.,27,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"The people who like maybe like the first person in their family, the first person in like that they know even, in their communities that are going to college.",28,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Going to try to like get get like a college education, really help a whole lot.",29,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And it's not like the government's going to have like infinite money that it's going to be willing to spend on higher education.,30,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So this money that you're going to be seeing spent on loan subsidies are probably going to if not offset like like if not like actively decrease the likelihood that people are going to wanna pay for that.,31,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"In the same way that when like the government subsidizes healthcare, the first thing certain political parties like to do is say: "" we need to cut medicaid "" which helps poor people.",32,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"You're probably gonna see similar things here, where when these like more broadly like when these programs that are in theory targeting the middle class, even though they're not doing enough, it's going to come at like a price tag and it's going to be conservative and say that we have to make cuts to like aid programs now.",33,,
DJ_3064_student-loans_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons I definitely think that we should not subsidize student loans.,34,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"We should limit executive compensation because it's a moral imperative and it would be economically beneficial as well, and it's ultimately not that big of a burden on these people.",1,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what this would actually look like.,2,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,There's a variety of ways in which we think it would be reasonable and feasible to limit executive compensation.,3,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"Whether it's by making it so that executives by law can only make a certain percentage more money than the lowest paid employee, so maybe like a couple hundred times more money, so maybe a CEO can only make at most a couple hundred times more than a janitor.",4,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"Or you could have a one hundred percent tax on revenues after a certain point, so maybe after like a couple of million dollars there is a one hundred percent tax, or something like that.",5,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,So now what would this be helpful in solving on a moral level?,6,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,I think that wealth inequality and income inequality is an incredibly harmful thing that has a horrible slew of consequences for society.,7,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,First and foremost this has a direct economic consequence on other people.,8,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,Because money in a society is more or less zero sum.,9,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"Obviously wealth can grow for a nation over time for a broad base, but by and large especially when it comes to executive compensation, you're talking about a a set pool of money.",10,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"And when more people at the very top or an elite or CEO's are getting more of that pie of money, that means that everybody else is getting a decreasing share that money.",11,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,So you're directly seeing a whole lot of other people have less money.,12,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,And that obviously has a slew of economic consequences.,13,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,Whether the economic consequences are that consumption isn't going to be as fueled because less people have money to spend.,14,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,it could mean that people are going to be held back in life because they don't have savings.,15,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,so maybe if there's an emergency they're going to be in big trouble.,16,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"they're not going to be as willing to invest in long term expenditures like houses or cars or their education, because they're not going to be able to like, they're not going to think that they have a firm enough financial footing to do those kinds of things.",17,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"And even moreover, rich people tend to just replace things that they have with more luxurious versions of the same thing, which don't really fuel a lot of economic production.",18,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"So like it's better if someone buys a car, that didn't have a car before, in terms of job creation and and product like creation, rather than just someone replacing their camry with a ferrari.",19,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,You're not really getting as much of a good there.,20,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,But beyond that I also think that this creates a feedback loop.,21,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,Because rich people have a tendency to get richer with the money that they have.,22,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"Because rich people can use that money, especially CEO's, they can give that money to hedge funds or like investment banks or mutual funds or all kinds of other entities to our invest their money in.",23,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,And with that they ultimately just end up making more money and that means that a lot of problems ultimately end up being cyclical and become more extreme over time.,24,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"And finally and beyond finally you also see political problems, especially in places like america where political speech is something that like political influence is something that is purchasable, you can buy and sell politicians basically, the more money you have the more political power you have.",25,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,Which makes it even more likely that you're going to be able to make more money and that your political preferences are going to get out sized in force.,26,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,So finally let's look at this on the comparative of what we're actually doing to people cost wise.,27,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,Because I feel like when you're already making millions and millions of dollars just losing a couple more millions of dollars isn't really all that big of a burden and it can help people a whole lot more.,28,,
DJ_3073_executive-compensation_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should limit executive compensation.",29,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not ban naturopathy.,1,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,For starters I wanna ground this debate by talking about things that we think are acceptable.,2,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Because totally banning something doesn't mean that you just have to leave it completely unregulated.,3,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Obviously a ban is incompatible with partial regulation, but I think it's perfectly fine to not ban something and instead have reasonable regulations on things.",4,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like maybe these people can't call themselves doctors- like literally medical doctors- like they want to, and that could be illegal.",5,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,you can regulate the way they market themselves in.,6,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,like the same way you can't call champagne champagne unless it's from france.,7,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"maybe you could have restrictions, like health insurance providers can't cover these kinds of things as medical expenses, so you have to pay for it yourself.",8,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,to use like economic incentives that discourage people from doing it.,9,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Maybe you could even go so far to have regulations on whether or not your kids should be able to have access to it.,10,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But banning the profession wholesale, completely stopping people from using naturopathy if they desire to, is I think far is just too far.",11,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So why is this the case?,12,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,I think we need to start by talking about like what we really value as like a in a free society and what we should be allowed to do with our bodies.,13,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because if there is anything that we should have control over, its being able to like make medical decisions, which are a really intimate thing, over our bodies and our health.",14,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Because that's a very important thing to you personally and you shouldn't you should have minimal government involvement in those kinds of individual decisions that people are making.,15,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that in general people are like autonomous and people are rational and people have brains, and they can make choices if they want to.",16,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And if naturopathy is something they want to pursue, then they might have some reason or and it might be a good reason.",17,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Moreover, or it might be a bad reason but that's fine too.",18,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Moreover it might be like a religious reason or spiritual reason.,19,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Things that the government certainly shouldn't have any business in mandating that people have to go against religious or spiritual beliefs.,20,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But to apply this a little bit more, I think that it's very important that, in these particular cases that we prioritize people's autonomy to do what they want with their bodies for the medical decisions.",21,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because keep in mind that this is really hurting anyone else in society, it's only going to be, the worst case scenario is that the person who is like engaging in naturopathy as their medical treatment is going to not get better, or maybe they're even going to get sick.",22,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,The worst case scenario is that person's going to die.,23,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"In which case, oh well, the government shouldn't be in the business of deciding how people live their lives down to like the like essence of like medical decisions, especially in that like you probably have a right to die as you see fit anyway in a lot of ways.",24,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And that certainly it's not the government's place to say how you should put a value on your life.,25,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Whether you want to live longer or shorter, if that means necessarily trade off with going against religious or spiritual beliefs that you may have.",26,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,The government isn't a place to put like any kind of moral value on what people wanna do with their lives and how they want to live with their how they want to live their lives.,27,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So like the worst case scenario is that these treatment simply don't work and that's unfortunate for people.,28,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But it's really like naive to think that people who go in for like naturopathy treatment don't like, aren't aware of possible risks and things like that.",29,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,In the same way that when people go to get traditional medical treatments people are aware of both possible benefits and side effects of treatment.,30,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons I think that we should leave it to people to decide their own medical treatments and not ban naturopathy.,31,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not ban naturopathy and I want to start by talking about what we can do because there's a lot of things that we can do short of actually fully banning something.,1,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We can obviously regulate it and we can regulate in a lot of ways.,2,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"We can regulate it so that they can't maybe call themselves formal doctors, we can regulate it so that maybe like kids don't have the same level of access to it because we don't think that it's safe for them.",3,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,There's all kinds of regulations and the specifics are that important but that's not what this debate is about.,4,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,This is a debate about whether a fully grown consenting adult in the best of circumstances given the facts and the information can't make their own choices about what they do with their own medicine.,5,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that this is obviously a situation where you should err on the side of individual rights make their own medical choices and you should not therefore ban naturopathy in its entirety.,6,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So I want to start by talking about what are some of the legitimate reasons why somebody may want to pursue naturopathy.,7,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It may first be because of spiritual or religious preferences that somebody has that favor specific kinds of medicine over others and that's that's that's a view that people are obviously entitled to do and it's their right to have and that's fine.,8,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Further people may be mistrustful of traditional medicine for whatever reasons.,9,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe they're a conspiracy theorist, maybe they just don't trust doctors because maybe some treatment that they had in the past was botched.",10,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,There's all kinds of reasons that people have and that can be personal and that's fine.,11,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So that was our first the reasons why somebody may want naturopathy.,12,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Next I want to talk about why it's legitimate choice to make people a right that people have the choice to make because obviously there are some things that you can regulate if people are acting off of inexact information or it's a coercive situation or whatever but oftentimes medical decisions may not necessarily function this way.,13,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,If you're getting medical decisions generally it's a more rational decision it's something that you think about in advance it's not like this spur of the moment kind of thing.,14,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"You usually contemplate it a little bit more but beyond that there's also just like a basic right to like pursue medical treatments the way in which you choose like if you want to get an abortion you should have that right, if you want to get some kind of surgery or not get some kind of surgery you should have that right.",15,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but at the very base of this, the the the worst extent of this is that maybe you could die if you end up getting naturopathy like.",16,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,the worst case scenario is that naturopathy means that you're not going to get cured and you're going to die if it's a particularly extreme case.,17,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,but even in that case I don't know why it's the government's place to decide on behalf of a person how they should live their life.,18,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because if you're like a spiritual person and you'd rather die early but but die in line with your spiritual beliefs than live a longer life going against what you believe like deeply, then that should be your choice to make as an individual.",19,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"like it really doesn't matter to society honestly to be like like real talk here if, like any individual person dies.",20,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It's a tragedy if people die outside of their own control.,21,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,it's a tragedy of people die if they don't want to die.,22,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but if somebody like is like like prepared, if they're like internally accepting and ready, then that should really be like a choice that people can make on like on their own and like, obviously, like there's a lot of things, like like you want to make sure that, like you're preventing things from like suicides and things like that,",23,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but like in the best of scenarios, when it's like a decision that people are making on their own medical treatments, this is fine, especially given that most situations aren't nearly as extreme as that case, when most of the time there really isn't a cost",24,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons don't ban naturopathy.,25,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,We should ban naturopathy because it is dangerous and because it results in doctor so called doctors abusing the trust that people put in them and giving them things that are incredibly harmful.,1,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what the justification for this ban is in the first place and I think this is pretty straightforward.,2,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,"Just to start, governments generally should be able to ban things if they're incredibly dangerous things.",3,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,We ban a whole lot of things that are incredibly dangerous.,4,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,We ban you can't have like machine guns.,5,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,You can't have like bombs.,6,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,You can't have heroin for the most part.,7,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,You can't have a whole lot of things that are dangerous because you shouldn't be able to use them.,8,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,"We also regulate in the same way, not just the ability of people to like consumer use dangerous things, but we also consume the sale of these dangerous things as well.",9,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,"so you're not allowed to put like arsenic in some kind of like, some kind of trendy new food, like all natural food that uses arsenic, instead of like high fructose corn syrup or whatever non-GMO or something like that.",10,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,Like you can't you're not allowed to put like these kinds like dangerous substances into foods or medicines or things that are supposed to be marketed to people as such.,11,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,So given this basis of a justification let's just talk why does naturopathy fulfill this very clear justification.,12,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,This bar that you need to meet for banning something and it's very straightforward.,13,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,It meets it in two ways.,14,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,"It first meets it because it doesn't actually solve the problems or purports to solve as medicine so in a lot of ways besides being dangerous, it's also false advertising.",15,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,"But you go to a doctor because you're sick, maybe you have the flu and you want to have the you wanna have the flu go away because you can't go to work, you you don't want to get other people sick, whole lots of problems here.",16,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,"So you go to the doctor and you get prescribed something or you get told what you can do to help the situation blah blah blah, and if the doctor gives you something that doesn't solve the problem at all, then that's obviously horrible.",17,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,The doctor took your money and ran off with it and your problem wasn't fixed.,18,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,"And that's really bad because rather than just having your money taken from you, you're also in a situation where your literal health problem isn't being solved.",19,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,So obviously that's really bad.,20,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,Beyond that there's also the problems of of you can even see these medicines so called medicine sometimes create additional problems.,21,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,So whether it's putting actively harmful ingredients into something or various kinds of treatments that aren't really medically advisable at all that can actually make things worse you could be actively making people more unsafe by giving them dangerous things with this kind of treatment.,22,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,But the final thing that I want to talk about is the trust that people put into doctors and how this breaks that trust because I think that people have a unique trust in doctors.,23,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,Obviously medicine is an incredibly tactical and specialized knowledge.,24,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,There's a reason you have to go to school for like basically like a decade in order to become a doctor.,25,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,Between medical school and trainings after medical school and all these kinds of things.,26,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,"It's very difficult become a doctor because there's a high level of knowledge and the conventional medicines that we prescribe, modern medicines, go under a heavy heavy scrutiny.",27,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,They have to be tested in a myriad of ways.,28,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,"They're reviewed across all kinds of different people, all different levels of trials, all different kinds of levels of scientific study unlike this nonsense like that is being propagated as so called medicine by like sham doctors.",29,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,They are essentially abusing the trust and being able to even call themselves doctors is definitely it's misleading to what people are actually getting.,30,,
DJ_3076_naturopathy_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should ban naturopathy.",31,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,We should limit the right of asylum because of issues of feasibility and because of issues of fairness.,1,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about issues the feasibility.,2,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,And this is important because the sad reality is is that too many people are eligible for asylum.,3,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,You can get asylum for a lot of reasons.,4,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"You can get it because of religious persecution, you could get it because of racial or ethnic persecution, you can get it because of gender based persecution, you can get it because of political persecution.",5,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"And that's really important, how wide it is.",6,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"Because when you're talking about all of those different types of persecution, you're talking about likely billions of people that face one form or another of persecution.",7,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"And that's important because the places in which these people would want to go to, developed countries, like places like the united states, simply don't have the capacity to take in all of these people who are being persecuted and while it's like obviously a really sad thing, it's just simply the way reality is.",8,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,Because there's first of all like space issues.,9,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,You can't just like put people in like the middle of some open space of land in wyoming.,10,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"You'll have to give these people you have to give people who immigrate resources, you have to like help them acclimate, you have to possibly they might be dependent on social services and things like that.",11,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,There is a lot of like resources that go up into this.,12,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,And that's a problem because when you have asylum that exists it's essentially just like a free pass in order to get into a country.,13,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,And you can bypass normal immigration processes.,14,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,So I think that that's like a big problem.,15,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,But the second thing is about an issue of fairness.,16,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"Because when we're talking about the ability to basically bypass the normal immigration process, to just get like accepted to the new country, I think this is unfair to a lot of people who aren't necessarily persecuted but are still pretty poor off.",17,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"Because just because there's not somebody trying to kill you on the basis of your religion or more likely someone who's like not giving you the right to vote or the right to like maybe get some kind of job because of your religion or something like that, isn't really all that fair compared to somebody who simply doesn't have economic opportunities in their country.",18,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,Somebody who simply is like in a really bad situation in their country.,19,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,Because there's a lot of people.,20,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"Like anyone who's emigrating is, well I'm not anyone, but most people who are emigrating are doing it because they want to have better chances, a better life in a new place.",21,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"And it's not really fair that some people get to essentially just because of like , they just because they happen to fall under a category of asylum they get to go into a place.",22,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"Like a lot of people when they emigrate, especially like like in america, a lot of people immigrate to america illegally and sometimes people don't even know they qualify for asylum.",23,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,And but they're emigrating anyway.,24,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,Because like people oftentimes emigrate for more murky reasons than just like a black and white like you're falling into a group of asylum or not.,25,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"And that's like important because the people who don't qualify asylum, especially when you can only take in a limited number of people because of limited resources, the people who wouldn't traditionally qualify for asylum deserve a chance at like deserve like a more equitable chance in immigration as well.",26,,
DJ_3163_asylum_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should limit the right of asylum.,27,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,We should not abolish the american jobs act because it's pretty important and it's something that we should keep for a couple of reasons.,1,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So first, we should keep the american jobs act because it supported some good projects.",2,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,It secured a lot of funding for things like infrastructure projects which I think are pretty important.,3,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,They're pretty important for a couple of reasons.,4,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"First, because infrastructure projects are generally good for the economy.",5,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"They create long term economic growth by fostering efficiency, ease of travel and transportation between markets.",6,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So all of those things are good but it's also good because it's nice from a quality of life standpoint.,7,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Like america has pretty trash infrastructure and that like annoys or aggravates most people.,8,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,People don't like that we don't have high speed trains going anywhere.,9,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,People don't like that our subway systems are very outdated and decrepit.,10,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,People don't like that our bridges are in critical condition.,11,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,People don't like that roads are constantly pothole-ridden.,12,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So you know, infrastructure projects and spending are pretty good things, widely popular.",13,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,No reason why we should just cut it now but the next thing that the american jobs act did that was very good is it established additional funding for a lot of additional public sector workers.,14,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So people like public school teachers got funding from it, firefighters got funding from it, like plenty a important public service workers got their like entities got funding under this and that's important because oftentimes these people don't get paid enough as is or if they do you get paid like a decent amount of money , their agree economic insecurity.",15,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,There is a fear that their jobs may go away at the at any kind of recession or on a political whim and that's not fair to these people and that's certainly not going to encourage people to do these jobs which are important jobs.,16,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So you want to make sure that you protect funding for them as well.,17,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So the final thing that I want to talk about is the comparative about even if there was some kind of hypothetical money problem to which it was just not possible for us to keep spending this money on helping the economy and people's lives, I think that there's things that are it's much better that we cut funding for other things than these things.",18,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"First, you can well there's like several there's actually three options.",19,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"First, you can just take out loans, you can deficit spend, there's no real reason why you can't do those kinds of things.",20,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,A lot of people a lot of governments deficit spend.,21,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,It's not really that big of a deal.,22,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Secondarily, you can raise taxes on the rich.",23,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,I don't really see any reason why that's a bit of a problem.,24,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Politically people might not politically rich people and politicians won't like it but I think it's a pretty solid idea.,25,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,You can also cut money from prisons.,26,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,You can cut money from police forces.,27,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,You can cut money from the military.,28,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,There's trillions of dollars that you can cut from there and those look like pretty good places.,29,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,I'd much rather have working roads.,30,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,I'd much rather have well funded public schools than like widespread prisons or having like a billion of like a billion of this new and up-to-date missile that kill more people.,31,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Those are priorities that I'm perfectly fine defending.,32,,
DJ_3166_jobs-act_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, don't abolish the american jobs act.",33,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,We should have year round schooling because it'll be better for the students who will be able to better enjoy their vacations and it'll also be better for actual learning.,1,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"So for starters, year round school obviously doesn't just mean that you go to school everyday of the year and you get rid of the summer.",2,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"We probably should have a similar number of days off, a similar number of vacations for people but now those can be better spread out.",3,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"So instead of getting just those three weeks, a spring break, and a winter break, and a couple of random holidays, now you can actually get more substantive vacation.",4,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,So maybe instead of getting just thursday and friday off for thanksgiving you get the whole week off.,5,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,Maybe instead of just getting instead of getting two weeks off for winter break you get a month off.,6,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,Maybe you get a month in the summer instead of three months and it would basically be a redistribution of the days off.,7,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,And I think that that would probably be a whole lot better for a couple of reasons.,8,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"First, because I think kids will like it more.",9,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"Most kids aren't going to be like losing the sacrifice of going to summer camp or something like that because most kids can't afford that and most kids, when they're going on some kind of trip or vacation, it's usually something that's a lot shorter, it's usually something that you can do within the confines of a month.",10,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,You don't really need a whole summer to do that.,11,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"And most of the time, the people that get affected the most are people who are just kind of sitting around all summer because they don't really have opportunities to do a whole lot of other things with their time over their summer.",12,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"Their parents work, so they're kind of just sitting around and they would probably be a whole lot better served.",13,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"And I think people, the students themselves would probably like this is if they were given more breaks where they can recharge their batteries.",14,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,Because being a student is pretty stressful.,15,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"You have a lot of things, you're taking a lot of classes, you have to do work when you get home usually you have extracurricular activities, you may have a job too, it's certainly no walk in the park being a kid especially if you're like being pushed academically or you're doing a sport or something like that.",16,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,You have a lot of things that you're usually doing so getting vacation days is nice and it's nice to have more than just a couple of days a year or two big breaks a year and then summer break.,17,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"It would probably be nice if those things were more spread out because people get burned out and in order to recover from the burn out you don't really need a whole summer, you only need maybe a couple of days or a week and that's something that I think from a health standpoint would be a lot better for kids.",18,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"But also there's the obvious benefits of memory and learning,",19,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,one of the biggest complaints that a lot of teachers have- and it makes a whole lot of sense- is that people forget things and you have to spend a and you have to spend like the,20,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"two of school just reviewing old material,",21,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,"three or more months just not studying or not really doing anything for school, you're probably going to forget those things and that's going to be pretty helpful in harmful or detrimental to your learning",22,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,But the final thing is that the idea of having a summer vacation and the winter break and things like the current system of vacation is pretty archaic.,23,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,It was like designed around the harvest basically like there's no real reason why we have vacations when we do.,24,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,It's just kind of something that's always existed so there's no real reason why we shouldn't try to get some reform through.,25,,
DJ_3168_year-round-school_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should have year round school.,26,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not prohibit tower blocks.,1,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We should keep building them.,2,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Maybe we should even build more of them.,3,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why we absolutely should not prohibit tower blocks.,4,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And the first one is because they are just outright necessary.,5,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We've seen an increasing trend towards urbanization over time and growth of cities because in a more global tech oriented economy it makes the most sense to focus on smaller clustered economic centers then to try to spread over a wider less concentrated areas.,6,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So if you're going to keep building in a city there's really only two options you build out you built up.,7,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So building up is just simply better than building out for a lot of reasons.,8,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,First and foremost building out makes transportation more difficult because you have to build out more roads build out more public transportation build out more services and the like on all kinds of things.,9,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Building out is worse for the environment for those reasons, because all of that further sprawl can lead to habitat destruction, ecosystem destruction, more urban sprawl- things like that that are bad.",10,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,it also means that you're going to see likely people be pushed out farther away from city centers.,11,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,so it's a lot less convenient and it's more annoying to have sprawl verses just going taller.,12,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,going taller is a whole lot better.,13,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Because when you go up you aren't disrupting the environment anymore you can build in more convenient locations and all those things.,14,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And this is additionally good because this can be specifically used to combat problems housing prices.,15,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So if you aren't building a lot of highrises or power blocks, then you're going to see more in a further exaggeration of an already existing problem, which is housing prices in cities becoming incredibly unaffordable for most people in the middle class and certainly a lot of people who are in the lower class.",16,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"and this is a lot of the things behind gentrification, where people get pushed out of neighborhoods, and this is a really big problem.",17,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But if you build more tower blocks if you keep building up the area and there's more of a supply of homes then the prices of these homes are more likely to go down so it's better able to actually satisfy the demand for housing so you are not going to see such a great glut of housing that housing isn't really accessible to people.,18,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But also tower blocks are good for a quality of life and enjoyment because like I was saying earlier about like how building out is annoying because it's sprawl and it's inconvenient because you're farther away from things the flip side of that is that if you build up it's easier to be close to things.,19,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So it's easier to be closer to like central parks.,20,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It's easier to be closer to central recreational areas central business areas central economic centers central areas of public transportation.,21,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So when you build up it's better you're a much better able to plan and organize and live your life in a more convenient way.,22,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,You're also more likely going to have access to important things like food grocery stores or more likely to have access to things like hospitals or emergency services and things like that.,23,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Because when it's a higher concentration of people it's more important that that big group of people get served and you're just geographically closer to them.,24,,
DJ_3172_tower-blocks_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should not prohibit tower blocks.,25,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Private universities should not be banned because private universities are pretty good, they don't really cause any problems and they're better than public universities in a good deal of cases.",1,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So let's start by talking about why private universities aren't really all that bad compared to like a lot of other private things, like private health insurance, things like that maybe.",2,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Most of most private universities are first nonprofits.,3,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"They're usually good schools, they usually do good are in research and development that benefits the public as well.",4,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"By and large, their biggest competition isn't so much public universities, it's like corporations and things like that.",5,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So like say the use the like research that's being done at places like stanford or MIT or harvard, is oftentimes really good for public welfare.",6,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And usually funded anyway by like government grants and projects and things like that.,7,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"It's usually helping fight diseases, helping develop like new technologies, just for the public good.",8,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"As opposed oftentimes corporations, who are doing it with like a much more profit based incentive in mind.",9,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So rather than simply developing things to make more money by selling it to people, a lot of times public research is happening at private universities and it simply the venue where these things are happening.",10,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So private universities are pretty good news.,11,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Private universities are also good because it allows education funding to be less politicized.,12,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"One of the one of the first things that tends to get cut when inevitably you have a recession, or you have some republican that comes along and thinks that you need to cut spending on everything to help rich people, and inevitably one of the earliest things to get cut is public education.",13,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Because they say: "" oh well you need to help it's bad for the private sector.",14,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Do other kinds of alternatives.,15,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Or spend it on other things instead, or don't spend that money at all. """,16,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And this is bad because if you ban all private universities then you're dependent on no universities or public university solely and that's bad because public universities are much more likely to see cuts.,17,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"I'm politically unpopular scientific programs, so maybe things like women's health research, stem cell research, things like that like really important medical research, these are all things that could be in jeopardy on political grounds and that's just not even containing the fact that like financially things can be less secure.",18,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Like the fact that there was a recession and politicians think they need to cut spending shouldn't mean that we like spend less on educating our future or cancer research or anything like that.,19,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Obviously those things wouldn't be very good.,20,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,But finally private universities just tend to have more tend to like already have a lot of money and are a good independent source of money.,21,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And I really don't think that the public education system can afford to be burdened with the addition of all the people who are already being privately educated.,22,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Because college costs a lot of money, and to run , so essentially replace all of the private universities with equivalent government options, it would require huge huge huge amounts of government investment government spending.",23,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Which I don't really think that the government necessarily has the ability to do right now, and even if it does, why do that?",24,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Like you can spend that money on a whole lot of other things.,25,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,That would be more useful.,26,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Because the alternative isn't all that bad.,27,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Private universities aren't really all that bad.,28,,
DJ_3174_private-unis_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons don't ban, don't ban them.",29,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"We should abolish marriage, because marriage is completely outdated, and it makes people unhappy, and marriage also oppresses people.",1,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"So, all of these things are independently very very bad, but let's first talk about how marriage as a structure makes a whole lot of people less happy.",2,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"And, I think it makes people less happy in a couple of ways.",3,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"First, it makes people unhappy in that a lot of people aren't meant to or enjoy a lifetime bond with a single sexual partner, and I think that that's incredibly important and I think",4,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"one of the reasons why a whole lot of developed countries divorce rates are very, very high and most marriages end in failure is",5,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"because, for most, most people are kind of always looking for more in life",6,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,people get bored after awhile with the same person.,7,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,people are looking for maybe something new or exciting.,8,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,people are looking for something different.,9,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"people may not want to have a family, people may not want to be tied down and things like that.",10,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,all of those are a like reasons why people may not want to necessarily be involved in marriage.,11,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"And this is incredibly important, because right now, marriages is essentially the like basic form of social organization in most countries around the world.",12,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"Most countries around the world have like some kind of system of marriage, and the family, and that's basically the system of social organization, and how people are raised.",13,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that that, in some ways, may be a problem, and it may be outdated, and, a lot of people aren't just simply happy with it, anymore.",14,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"Another obvious area, in which marriage makes people unhappy, is the idea that like marriage is something special, especially if you're someone who tries to put more of a religious significance to marriage.",15,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,You may not be able to engage in things like premarital sex or things like that.,16,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,other kinds of practices are more likely to be shamed or frowned upon.,17,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,having like an open marriage or like an open relationship or things like that are things that are more likely going to be frowned on or condemned and those only serves to further make it so that people are less likely to be happy.,18,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"But, I also think that marriage is very very bad, and that it's oppressive for women, and it's oppressive for gender minorities as well, and people who have different sexualities as well.",19,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"So, why is this true?",20,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,The obvious reason for this is that the idea of marriage is that it was based on like a sexist idea that there's two things that are necessary in life.,21,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"essentially, you need to make sure that you can do god's work and like raise the next generation of people, and things like that, and you- oh, I guess- also do god's work and like make a whole lot of money as the man and things like that.",22,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that breaking down these norms are going to be incredibly difficult to do, because, while more women than ever are entering the workforce and more men are being willing to do housework, there's still obviously a significant imbalance and there's still obviously a significant disparity here, and I think that that's very unlikely to ever truly change overall.",23,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"and I think that the big reason for that is because the institution itself of like monogamous marriage is structured in such a way that it disadvantages women, especially when, like women are like, oftentimes going to earn less money compared to men and things like that.",24,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"societies are structured in a way in that, as long as we have marriage and that there is an option for women to become dependent on men, or an easier way for women to become dependent on men and not as economically active, there's going to be social pressures that are going to meet this much, much more likely, and I think that when you abolish marriage, that's going to be less of a problem",25,,
DJ_3177_marriage_pro.trs.txt,"So, for all those reasons, we should abolish marriage.",26,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"We should prohibit international adoption, for two big reasons.",1,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"First because it creates a perverse incentive against spending in domestic adoption infrastructure, which is vastly preferable to international adoption, and secondarily, because it can it carries a large degree of risk as being a front for bad things, like human trafficking.",2,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about these things.",3,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"First, we'll talk about the perverse incentives that are created.",4,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"So, there's generally going to be, in most countries, political will against spending too much on adoption things.",5,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"Whether it's foster care systems, or similar infrastructure that makes it so that people, who are put up for adoption, are actually able to live good childhoods, and be prepared for later life.",6,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,So the problem is is that there is already going to be very few people that advocates for them.,7,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"a lot of these, these kids, aren't going to have like political rights or political agency and they're not going to get that until after they're no longer really affected by the system.",8,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"and it's also oftentimes difficult to find people who, on the list of issues they want to advocate for, on like a social justice or movement level, to advocate for the like- not not like massive but still seizable number of people who are affected by the adoption system.",9,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"There's also general incentives against public spending on a lot of matters and things like that, especially in developing countries where, overwhelmingly, where the people are being put out for international adoption.",10,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"by and large, you see people being adopted from developing countries or maybe places in like eastern europe.",11,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"you don't see like americans being put up for adoption and like a family in like namibia is adopting them or angola, things like that.",12,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"So this is important, because what this does is essentially creates an excuse for governments, and for society to let down these people, who are put up for adoption, but aren't one of the few lucky people that gets adopted by an international family.",13,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"Because, what it ultimately creates is like a where you can just push the problem to other countries, try and push the problem away, create a system that caters to international adoption.",14,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"But it creates an incentive in that, you're not actually going to fix more root problems, which I think is pretty bad.",15,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"I also think that this is going to amplify a whole lot of biases that are going to exist, because keep in mind that when we are talking about international adoption, a lot of people are going to have certain preferences.",16,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"maybe they're going to have preferences for, like, men over women or things like that, and I think that a lot of these kinds of things- the people who get left behind, they could end up being minorities, they could end up being people who are otherwise disadvantaged, and that's not something that is very good, and they're not the people who should be getting the least support from the system",17,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"But I think that the other thing that, it's important to talk about is the risk of human trafficking and the like, because keep in mind that, it's oftentimes very difficult to put checks in place.",18,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"Background checks can only get you so far, and especially if you haven't been caught for doing something yet, then you're not gonna have any kind of criminal record.",19,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"So, only the most obvious people are actually getting out of these kinds of things.",20,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"So keep in mind that, you're talking about taking people, like you could possibly be taking, like, infants from developing parts of the world, and putting them in the hands of who knows who?",21,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"Just about anyone that's willing to accept them, because there's always going to be more people eligible for adoption than people willing to take them.",22,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,And there's always going to be this pressure to push more people out into families that are willing to take them.,23,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think that this does create a lot of system where it's possible that these children won't be treated right, that these parents aren't going to be all that great, at the very best cases, or it may be more widespread parts of things like human trafficking, which are incredibly widespread, if under discussed, problems in international society, and the like.",24,,
DJ_3179_international-adoption_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should prohibit international adoption.",25,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,We should not have universal health care because healthcare should be a choice that people have and I think that introducing universal healthcare would get rid of a lot of choice in very bad ways.,1,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"The first is that universal health care means that everyone has to pay for health insurance, and people can't choose to not pay for health insurance.",2,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And I'm not sure that I like the sound of that.,3,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"For example, you have a whole lot of young people, or someone like me, who went to the doctor twice last year.",4,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Once for a check up at a pediatrician, and once for a check up in a dentist, and both of them said my health was fine, my teeth were fine, and that's it.",5,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Didn't have any other, didn't have to bother with drugs didn't have to bother for preventative research preventative treatment or anything like that.",6,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And yet, my health insurance cost thousands of dollars a year because I'm forced to pay for it.",7,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And those are thousands of dollars that I could be spending on almost anything else.,8,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"It's money that I can be seen evening, so I can like live my life better and more securely, it's money that I could be using to like buy maybe even something frivolous, but that's good for the economy because it boosts consumption.",9,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"It's it be money that I would be I could be investing, it's not necessarily both good for the economy obviously, for those reasons, but it's not really good for me either.",10,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And it eliminates a crucial choice that I have about what I need to be spending my money on.,11,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So I don't really think that that's good.,12,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Because universal healthcare is probably gonna like require via tax increases that I spend a lot of money on a service that most people don't need.,13,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"It would be much better it may be like like you can make like like maybe like healthcare to be more accessible, or it could be more heavily subsidized, but the way in which universal healthcare is going to be is usually conceptualized, via like single pay or a public option or something like that, it means that really everyone's gonna have to pay for it.",14,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"But the other side of it that's bad is that it also means that you're probably going to have less diversity in coverage options, because they're going to be more politicized in nature, and that's not really good either.",15,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So when you have like private health care options, you can just like get the private options that suits you.",16,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So, like obviously if you're like a woman, which like a lot of people are women, they're not going to have to worry about suddenly there's going to be a federal law in place that says that all government health services aren't going to pay for things like abortions, or contraceptions or anything that seems to be like offensive to public morals or some other nonsense like that.",17,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And these are like pretty realistic things.,18,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"There's things that the government is already trying to do nowadays, or at least like half the country's government is trying to do nowadays.",19,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So it would be like pretty bad if like the way in which healthcare is happening is dependent on the government.,20,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Or like maybe you're not allowed to do you like like something like stem cell related things, because it's seen as like offensive to fetuses feelings or something like that.",21,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Like these are all things in which like you don't actually necessarily want the government or the state to be in all that much control of like the healthcare system.,22,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Because they may not really do a very good job running it in the first place.,23,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And like even if the private sector has a profit incentive, at least they're going to be more responsive to what people need.",24,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Because if there's a whole lot of people who don't really care about a amorphous, stupid public morals and wants to not have to get an unwanted pregnancy or want to be able to like safely get a new liver or whatever, if they need",25,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"one, if they need to replace it or something like that, and they're not really worried about the fact that, like religious people think that's bad, then the government, then, like markets, are able to recognize that and give options for things like that",26,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that like you definitely wanna have like private options in place while as opposed to like these universal public options that gets floated around a lot.,27,,
DJ_3182_universal-health-care_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons don't introduce universal healthcare.,28,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,We should not adopt socialism because socialism violates people's rights en masse and also socialism isn't a very good practical solution to actually getting the best economic growth that you can.,1,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why socialism is inherently rights violative.,2,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"The first things that the main basis of socialism is essentially government redistribution of wealth via like, usually it comes in the form of like heavy taxation and the creation of social welfare programs and things like that.",3,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"So, these things, first and foremost, are necessarily often expansive, especially if we're going to be adopting socialism broadly.",4,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,So what they require is quite massive government taxation and government seizure of property.,5,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,Because in and a lot of ways the individual ownership of property and the idea of private property is basically like the antithesis of socialism and collective ownership.,6,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,So this is bad because you should have a right to your stuff.,7,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"If you build something that somebody else didn't build, you're the person who did that so you should have some kind of right to it.",8,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"If you create some kind of invention you should have, and other people find it very useful, you should be able to be rewarded for a lot of the hard work that you put into, things like that.",9,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"But in addition to that, I think beyond the fact that just like you have a right to ownership over the things that you create, I think that the state, certainly nor does the state nor anyone else certainly doesn't have a right to any of those things.",10,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,The state does not have a right to your property.,11,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"Even if like yours, even if like in some world you don't have a right to it, the state certainly does have not have any real right to your property.",12,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,The state didn't put the work into it in the way you did.,13,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"And moreover, the state using its coercive force and the threat of violence or imprisonment or being a law breaker, essentially forces you into stealing your property.",14,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"It's no different than if somebody were to put a gun to your head, and therefore the state isn't legitimate in taking your stuff away unless you just consent into it.",15,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,And additionally I don't think that other people in society have a right to the benefits of your property either.,16,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"Because like I said before, they didn't actually do anything to make it possible, its creation possible in the first place.",17,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,They don't really have any claim to it whatsoever.,18,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,But additionally socialism is also bad for outcomes.,19,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,For a couple of reasons: first and foremost because the free market is an incredibly effective way to ensure economic growth.,20,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,There's a reason why the rise of capitalism has coincided with a revolution and a change of human history in the way in which society is progressing.,21,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"I'm not gonna pretend it's always in the most equal ways, nor is it always the prettiest thing ever, but at the end of the day it does bring the largest amount of progress for the largest amount of people.",22,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"So that's something that has going for us, which is pretty good.",23,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"But additionally having socialism gives you a lot of opportunities for corruption, due to the consolidation of power, essentially, in the hands of non competitive government sector.",24,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"Which makes it much more likely that you're going to have like entrenched interests, you're not going to be as responsive to the market, you're not going to be as responsive to constituents and things like that.",25,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"Because in a lot of ways businesses have to be almost more accountable than politicians do in a lot of context, because you need to rely, like basically our lifeblood is relying on business and being able to get their interest.",26,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"But when it comes to politics, oftentimes the political calculis get more complicated than that.",27,,
DJ_3185_socialism_con_YBE_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, do not adopt socialism.",28,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,We should adopt socialism because socialism is fantastic on a moral level and on an economic level.,1,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what socialism in most forms actually looks like.,2,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"And by and large it's classified as extensive public support networks, and making sure that basic goods and services are available to everyone in a really equitable fashion.",3,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"So this looks like things like social security, like intensive pension plans, strong labor unions so they can advocate for workers rights, universal healthcare, maybe even universal basic income.",4,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,These kinds of policies that would fall under the umbrella of socialism basically.,5,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,So why are these things good?,6,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,So first and foremost most of these things are just things that people should have a right to you and are necessary to people's lives.,7,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"When you're talking about something like healthcare, you look at places like america, which are one of the only developed countries in the world that doesn't guarantee access to healthcare or have some kind of public option.",8,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"You look at things like the ability of people to stay alive, the ability of people to literally be healthy and be happy is something that comes with an exorbitant price tag.",9,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"And even if it's not from like a market perspective, something that's like efficient, obviously this is something that's so important to the like basic human happiness that it's something that you want to try to guarantee access for.",10,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"You know, we guarantee a lot of rights in a lot of parts in places like america.",11,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"You have a right to freedom of speech, you have the right to vote, you have a lot of rights.",12,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"But rights to things like healthcare, rights to financial security, these kinds of things are far more important in a lot of ways.",13,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,You could live without a right to religion.,14,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,You could live with that.,15,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"But you can't live if you're dying because you don't have the ability to stay healthy, because you can't afford medicine.",16,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"You're not going to be able to meaningfully access your right to freedom of speech if you're like constantly working and you don't have the ability to actually speak out politically, because there's a fear of political consequences of speaking out.",17,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,You're not going to be able to take advantage of a whole lot of like basic level things of happiness in life.,18,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"And there is a whole lot more to life than simply just like living for your job, living for work and things like that.",19,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,And I think that socialism makes it possible so that people can actually be comfortable in the lives of their living because they don't have to worry about putting food on the table and starving or having their kids being starving.,20,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"They don't have to worry about being homeless, you don't have to worry about these kinds of things because the state provides it for them.",21,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"And beyond that, sure, there might be some levels of inequality.",22,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"There might be some people who have more luxuries than other people, but in terms of the ability to actually survive on a day to day basis, that's something that I think that everyone just morally has an equal claim to.",23,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,So socialism should be adopted for for those reasons.,24,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,But beyond that it's good for the economy too.,25,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,When people are when people have more money they can fuel consumption.,26,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"Rich people by and large just kind of like park their money in bank accounts or in investments or upgrade things and aren't upgrade goods, so like instead of a toyota you got like a maserati or something.",27,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,So you're not really creating new consumption and it's more of transferable consumption or no consumption at all.,28,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,And that's good because economies are primarily driven by the consumption of goods and services.,29,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,So we get more of that through socialism and more purchasing power.,30,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,But also there's just gonna be more research development and innovation and more creativity.,31,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"Because you're going to have more people in the work in qualified workers, you're going to have more educated workers, and more people that are able to participate in the economy.",32,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"In the same way in which like there is a huge economic gains when women were able to participate in the workforce, right now a lot of poor people are locked into certain kinds of jobs because they can't get access to certain kinds of training and education to get out of it.",33,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,And that gets solved with socialism.,34,,
DJ_3185_socialism_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, adopt socialism.",35,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"We should abolish zoos, because they are both inherently immoral, and it is impossible to get rid of the structural incentives for zoos to do immoral things that, are akin to torturing animals.",1,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about why zoos are inherently immoral.",2,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"Keep in mind that, first I think that zoos are, as far as comparison is concerned, not very important to people.",3,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"Keep in mind that zoos are not necessary for people, they exist purely for our entertainment and our amusement.",4,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"They do not fill any real need whatsoever, and therefore, all their moral value is limited to the fact they cause a basic level of human pleasure.",5,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think that that, quite clearly, is of a lower degree of moral weight, than actual pain, actual suffering, and actual loss, if that loss exists.",6,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about animals.",7,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"Keep in mind that first, most animals do experience emotions, most most animals experience pain, they experience loss, they can experience these kinds of things.",8,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"Most animals also are able to recognize that they are essentially trapped in a cage, that they don't have as much space to roam as they naturally would in the wild.",9,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"A lot of animals are not maybe necessarily even captive bred, that they were taken out of the wild, and they essentially go into states of shock, all of these things are incredibly harmful for animals.",10,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"The fact they could be separated from their family, habitats, they oftentimes can be too small, all these other kinds of things.",11,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"So, why are all these things structurally incentivized in the worst way possible?",12,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"A few reasons: first and foremost, there's always going to be an incentive to make sure that, the habitats are going to be on the smaller size, and the habitats are going to have less places for animals to actually do their own kinds of things freely.",13,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"Because keep in mind that, the point of zoos, and the way in which zoos make money, is the animals have to be visible.",14,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"So the in order for the like the animals to be visible, it can't be such a big enclosure, where the animal can just kind of go into hiding, there can't be places where the animal can hide, otherwise the purpose of the zoo is lost, you're just kind of looking at an empty enclosure.",15,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"So there's going to be structural incentives in place to make sure that the animals are always going to be on display, that the animals can always be gaped and gawked at, and I think that",16,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"this means that the there are necessarily are incentives in place to make sure that the habitats are small, that the habitats don't have maybe as many places for shelter or things like that for the animals, and it forces them to be on display",17,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"I think that additionally, besides just like the enclosures themselves being problematic, there's also incentives for the kinds of animals being problematic.",18,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"Because, people don't go to zoos to see like armadillos, or bugs, or like crabs, or things that are on like the lower level of like, coolness, as far as animals are concerned.",19,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"People go because they want to see guerrillas, they go because they want to see elephants, they go because they want to see whales and lions, because they carry more of because they're like more complex but also more exotic, and interesting animals to like observe in a lot of ways.",20,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"So that's a big problem, because these are the animals that have the most to lose by being trapped in an enclosure.",21,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,They're the ones that most need the larger spaces.,22,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"They're the ones that, are most emotionally complex to suffer from the loss of being separated from family members.",23,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"They are the ones that most have the natural instincts to, like, hunt, or things like that, they're the ones that most are able to recognize the circumstances, that they're in, being a problem.",24,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think that the most degree of moral harm is going onto animals, who are having the most to lose, and I think that's something that's bad.",25,,
DJ_3187_zoos_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, abolish zoos.",26,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Big governments should not be abandoned in fact big governments are quite good.,1,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,First because big governments are more efficient and effective at enacting policies.,2,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And second big governments are actually more democratic than small governments often are.,3,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why bigger governments can more efficiently and effectively solve problems.,4,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,The first one is that oftentimes problems should be enacted uniformly in order for them to be properly enacted.,5,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So when you're talking about things for example like discrimination these are problems that can't be tolerated no matter where they're acting and you can't just operate under under the auspices of like individual choice or the like to do things like just by discriminations.,6,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So you need to have national and big government laws to operate these things.,7,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But besides issues of discrimination and rights, where you need to make sure that you have uniform, big policies in place, it's also important for things like taxes,",8,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"because keep in mind that, let's say, you're a business in new york and, despite you doing a lot of operations in new york, you can maybe set up an official corporate headquarters in a place like delaware or whatever, where they have different tax systems and different tax structures in place which can be used as a way to avoid taxes, or maybe even set up an offshore account and the like, and big governments are going to have a lot more resources in order to actually crackdown on these kinds of things",9,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"in theory at least, you do have this, even if they don't always do that, so you're better able to avoid loopholes and better able to enforce laws and make sure that you're enforcing them fairly and uniformly.",10,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But additionally when you're enacting big programs like social safety programs for things like healthcare programs or social security they're a lot better the more people you have it for a few reasons.,11,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"First and foremost, there is the economies of scale, in that when you're doing it is a bigger group, you have more negotiating power.",12,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"so if you're doing something like negotiating drug prices or negotiating wages and salaries, if you're like a bigger group, you have more negotiating power.",13,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,that's why it's better to have like.,14,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,that's the same reason why people like to unionize: because it gives you more bargaining power.,15,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So if you have a bigger government it has more bargaining power to argue on behalf of the people with like a corporation for example.,16,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But you can also spread risk more effectively which is really important because like the main idea on an insurance scheme is that you have as many people as possible buy into it so you can spread risk across a bigger pool of people which makes it a feasible strategy.,17,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And if you have a bigger government you have a bigger tent of people so you can spread risk better which is better.,18,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But additionally bigger governments are also more democratic and I think that the big reason why they're more democratic is because people can't really be bothered focusing on all different levels of government.,19,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"It's very difficult to focus on local elections state elections and federal elections because it's just a lot to take in and people are busy, people are working, people have things to do in their lives.",20,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,The people tend to naturally gravitate towards national policies.,21,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,People tend to be most informed about what national policies are as opposed to more local policies.,22,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,They tend to have more of a focus on that and this is reflected in media coverage in the like as well.,23,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And further the people who are going to be most advantaged by this comparative apathy are going to be special interests and lobbyists and the like which is why it's a whole lot easier for corruption to take place on the local level lobbyists who affect on the local level and things like that because there is a lot less checks against that.,24,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Because the biggest check against misconduct is citizen awareness and shining a light on these kinds of things and that's a whole lot more likely to happen on the national government level.,25,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So ultimately you actually get a more democratic and accountable government if it's bigger.,26,,
DJ_3188_big-governments_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons big government should not be abandoned,27,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,We should fight nationalism because it is incredibly difficult to critique the state and ultimately try to get better policies when you have a lot of nationalism and additionally because nationalism is immoral and it's something that ought be fought.,1,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"So let's start by talking about why it is in order to essentially live up to the ideals of democracy in a free society, it's necessary to fight nationalism.",2,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that the first reason for this is because when you have an overwhelming sense of nationalism, it ultimately corrupts policy and it corrupts decision making in incredibly profound ways.",3,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that the way in which this happens is in that politicians, people who can be like perceived as like strong men or or just individual people, essentially appeal to oftentimes the worst impulses of people.",4,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"The ideas that we need to preserve particular ways of life, the idea that you need to be greedy and put yourself and your own self interests before others, the idea that descent and critiquing things like the military or police forces are un-american or un-nationalistic.",5,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"things like this are ultimately incredibly bad because obviously, first and foremost, I think that a lot of them are bad, which is basically the second thing we're going to talk about.",6,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,But also it has a very important impact on suppressing discourse and ultimately denying an ability to really dissent is meaningfully against unjust actions.,7,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And this is the case,8,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"because, when you're being labeled as anti-american or anti against- against your own people, it becomes more difficult to state your arguments,",9,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"because, instead of it becoming a discussion about the issues itself at hand, it becomes a discussion about your identity and a discussion about whether or not you're even like rationally looking for the betterment of society, as opposed to some kind of insidious actor that's trying to undercut the the good of your own country",10,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And I think that that's a big problem.,11,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,But additionally I also think that nationalism is immoral.,12,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And I think that it's immoral in a fundamental way in that it's very greedy and exclusive.,13,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"Nationalism is often predicated on the idea that you need to put the nation and national pride, amongst other things, and that this is a very important thing.",14,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And I think that this is a bad thing several fold.,15,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"First and foremost, I think that national loyalty and identity and things like that aren't things that simply should be owed to a state.",16,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,You don't owe allegiance to a state.,17,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And the reason for that is because it an allegiance should be something that is earned and it's earned on the basis of representing the values of what you think are good.,18,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And if a state doesn't do that then you are within your right to go against that and fight against that.,19,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And ways that suppress you from doing that are immoral.,20,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"Additionally, it's an oftentimes incredibly greedy mindset that leads to you messing up a lot of people in a lot of places.",21,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,It can lead to things like colonialism or imperialism or wars and things like that with the intent of getting your own resources enriched and things like that.,22,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,"It can be seen as exclusionary because you don't want to see a risk to your alleged way of life, or you don't want to let in other people from other countries because you see that as a threat to your own life and things like that.",23,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,And I think that it creates this kind of false narrative about what the actual impacts are.,24,,
DJ_3193_nationalism_pro.trs.txt,So for all of those reasons we should fight nationalism.,25,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"We should abandon television, because it is archaic, expensive, unnecessary, and not good enough compared to what we have.",1,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about the comparative first, because that's a very big part of this debate.",2,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"I think that the comparative is that, when we abandon television, we ultimately have an alternative, and I think that that alternative, in our present technological age, is likely to be the internet.",3,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So, what we're going to argue is that, the using the internet as a replacement for television is vastly preferable to the status quo.",4,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So, I think there's two big reasons for this: first of which is money related, and the second of which is actualizing on your preferences.",5,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So, first, let's talk about money.",6,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So, televisions are incredibly expensive.",7,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"First and foremost you have to buy the TV itself, and you oftentimes have to buy like newer televisions, if you want to keep up with technology, so televisions themselves are expensive, and getting a good TV that works well can also be expensive.",8,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"Additionally, you have to find space for all that television.",9,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"Additionally, you also have to find you have to pay for a cable box, you to pay for a cable plan, which can be expensive, or a satellite plan.",10,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"Additionally, you have to pay for all like the electricity that it uses, things like that.",11,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"And these things can be expensive, I mean TV's can like several hundred dollars, cable can be like fifty dollars a month, or things like that, these aren't costs these things aren't nothing, so those that's important to note.",12,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"The other thing is because internet is so important, you likely have to pay for internet anyway.",13,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So you're paying for all of these things, on top of internet, which can provide the pretty much same services roughly as television.",14,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"And, that's important, because, if you want like news, you can get news off the internet, if you want entertainment, you can get that off the internet, if you want videos, you can get that off the internet, there really isn't anything unique in value, that TVS provide, that you can't just get off of a computer.",15,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So, it's basically just like a pointless waste of money, and I really don't understand why we shouldn't just abandon television, and move more towards like internet focused models.",16,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"This is especially important for poor people in society or younger people in society who may not also have the money for these kind of things, because they shouldn't be like like whether it's news or more like official forms of news, so they don't have to be reliant on internet blogs or bigger budget entertainment projects.",17,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"these kinds of things shouldn't be like closed off to like people in society just because they don't have the money to pay for it, and I think that the internet is good as a comparative to TV, because it gives more people the ability to view these kinds of things.",18,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"But I also think that, abandoning television will be good for people's preferences, because in the status quo, in order to actually like get something that you want on television, there need to be enough people in society that actually agree with you.",19,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So, there's less opportunities for experimental things, there's less opportunities for independent things, because there is a fear that not enough people are going to like it for it to actually succeed on TV.",20,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"But when you take a lot of the financial problems out of this, the result that you get is when you have it focused on internet, is that anyone can put out content on the internet, or you can have a much easier",21,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"because there's like less of a limit of air time, where you don't have to give the air time to the things that are going to make the most money and limited time slots",22,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,this results in just a wider pool of content that you can choose from.,23,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"Because you can essentially have like an endless library, that people can view at any time.",24,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So, that's important, because I think that what it results in is people can now watch what they want, when they want, at their own convenience, and in a lot of ways that's just a whole lot better for people, actually actualizing on their preferences.",25,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So basically, like television is expensive, and it's not even that good at providing entertainment, or news, which is what its goal is supposed to be.",26,,
DJ_3194_television_pro.trs.txt,"So, for all those reasons abandon television.",27,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,We should ban casinos because casinos basically allow profit to be extracted from people in a pretty coercive way and they also facilitate a lot of social dis utility in terms of like crime that is often affiliated with casinos so let's start by talking about why casinos are just bad and they're something that we should regulate anyway.,1,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,And I think that the basic point here is that we paternalize people a lot of the time when it comes to do with like their money and making reasonable and rational decisions.,2,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,"We limit what people can spend their money on, if we think that it's something that can be like coercive to them.",3,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,Especially when it in it's in terms of like the accuracy of the product that they're being sold on.,4,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,"Like literally, the consumer financial protection bureau by and large exists to make sure that like accurate information is being prevailed to consumers and like our regulatory agencies around the world primarily exists for this kind of a purpose.",5,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,And I think that's a big deal because casinos are basically inherently inaccurate in the kind of product they sell.,6,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,They basically sell a fantasy picture of you're by random chance sometimes going to win some money.,7,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,You spend some money and maybe by random chance you're going to win some money.,8,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,But by and large it's not really like that.,9,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,"Because I think that this evokes an image of like sometimes you're going to win and sometimes you're going to lose, but the reality is that almost certainly you're going to lose.",10,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,"Because, you're probably going to lose because oftentimes it's like rigged to make sure that you're more likely to lose.",11,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,And that's why I like the house usually wins.,12,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,"Whether it's in terms of like some kind of a card game, or whether it's like a card game or like a slot machine or something like that.",13,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,"It set up in a way, and that's like the base of their industry, to be profit maximizing.",14,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,"If you are going to like win like as like if you're going to win roughly like an equivalent amount of money that you're spending and it's just like a fun game that you're playing, then casinos couldn't really exist as multi billion dollar like empires basically.",15,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,They make billions and billions of dollars because the money that gets put into it isn't the same.,16,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,And that's why I feel like gambling is almost like a bad term.,17,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,"Because gambling really is, it's like almost more like a lottery, to be honest, in that like you throw money at it and there's like a small small chance you're going to win.",18,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,And I think that's a problem because like it's basically selling like a false narrative and allows like the economic extraction of a lot of people.,19,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,But also casinos are oftentimes affiliated with crime and that's like a pretty bad thing too.,20,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,Casinos tend to like bring in a lot of like problematic things.,21,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,"So like they tend to be associated heavily with like heavy alcohol use which often times can be associated with crimes and like violence or property damage or things like that, oftentimes casinos can be associated with drug use and things like that, they can also oftentimes be associated with prostitution and things looked out as well.",22,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,Like this is just obviously true when you look at places like las vegas.,23,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,So that kind of crime is oftentimes ushered in by the existence of casinos as well.,24,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,Because it's basically like a signaling to like more unsavory vices.,25,,
DJ_3195_casinos_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should ban casinos.,26,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"We should increase immigration to the united states for two big reasons: first because it's something that I just think is a basic aspect of empathy and common shared humanity that we should extend to other people, and secondarily, even if you don't actually care about other people and you only care about yourself, immigration is probably still good for you too.",1,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why we should as a issue of like humanitarian principles increase immigration to the united states.,2,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,It's important to recognize that in a lot of parts of the world people are a whole lot less fortunate than us.,3,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"People have to survive off of way less money than the average person in america lives off of, people have to fear persecution based on their identity, their sexuality, their ethnicity or their race, people have to be afraid about like famine and disease and all kinds of things and people have to care and there's a whole lot of issues.",4,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"Sometimes these things are out of america's control, other times the united states was a direct force involved in a lot of the crises.",5,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"Whether it was part of economic exploitation or imperialism or military campaigns, in a lot of cases the united states was one way or another involved.",6,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,But I think that's besides the point.,7,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"Because at the end of the day we're talking about people, when they want to immigrate to the united states, we're talking about people who just want a better life.",8,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"We're not talking about, for the most part, people who come here because they wanna harm us, we're not talking about people who wanna do bad or take people's jobs or anything like that.",9,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,We're talking about people who realize that they aren't simply going to be able to live the lives that they dream of living where they currently are so they want to come to america because they think that they can have better opportunities there and they hope that will give that opportunity to them.,10,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that when you're talking about the richest country in the world, the richest country in the history of the world, I think we can do a bit more to let more people in.",11,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"To increase immigration to realize that, you know what?",12,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,It's really not the end of the world if we let more people in if we extend a helping hand to people who need it.,13,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,And I think that's a really important principle that we should abide by more increasing immigration to the united states.,14,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,But the second thing that I want to talk about is matters of economics and self interest.,15,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,Because I think that it's really good for the united states as a whole as well if more people are coming in.,16,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,So first and foremost you look at a lot of like skilled industries very much rely on international labor forces.,17,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"When you look at like academia, when you look at fields in technology or all kinds of things like that, oftentimes you have people around the world who are highly skilled, who possess specialized skills, who are only going to be able to contribute to like american businesses, to american universities and things like that, and these people wanna come to america",18,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"because they want to like offer their skills to companies here that are willing to take them, and obviously it's good for those businesses, our economy, if we let the skilled people in",19,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"But when you're talking about like unskilled workers as well, I don't really see much of a problem here.",20,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"Because as much as like people like to complain and scapegoat immigrants as stealing their jobs, the same people very much appreciate when their basic bills, when their food, when the when the toys that they buy for their kids, they appreciate when these things don't cost an exorbitant amount of money.",21,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,They appreciate when these things are affordable.,22,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,And that affordability is helped when you have immigrants come in to perform cheaper labor in a lot of contexts.,23,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"Honestly, this and a lot of ways can help us prevent outsourcing, keep corporations here, and a lot of these jobs are undesirable to americans anyway.",24,,
DJ_3196_immigration-us_pro.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, we should increase immigration to the united states.",25,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,We should not limit the right of self defense.,1,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And we shouldn't limit the right of self defense because other people and most certainly not the state should be able to tell you how what is the best way and to keep you safe.,2,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,What is the most effective way when your life is in danger to secure your life?,3,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Obviously a freedom that you have.,4,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So here's the problem: when we talk about things when we talk more like precisely about what a limiting to the right of defense would look like, it would mean maybe things like a duty to flee, so like you try to escape first, duties to deescalate, maybe shooting to like hinder rather than kill, things like this.",5,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And these things obviously can sound somewhat reasonable on its face, obviously you don't wanna like give someone like a roadside execution, if they're like doing petty robbery, but you think your life is in danger.",6,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Because obviously there's still things like rights to trial, proportionate punishment, things like this, and these are important things.",7,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,But the thing to keep in mind is that nothing is more important than your own safety and your life.,8,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Because at the worst case scenario is the like the harm is that the person who is initiating the attack in the first place is going to die, but that's no greater of a consequence than the extreme on the other end, which is that you would die.",9,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So you're making a choice between the two.,10,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"You want to pick between the you want to pick a person who isn't doing anything wrong and who should have this right to self defense in the first place, so that they can like just live their life really.",11,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And the problem is that I don't really think that a lot of the standards that would be put on, or the limits on a right to self defense would be all that fairly applied.",12,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Because it's very easy to say , especially after the fact, when you're maybe putting somebody on trial for like using wrongful self defense or you're investigating something after the fact.",13,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"It's very easy to, after the fact say: "" well, in my situation, from where I am, you could have ran.",14,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"You could have done this this or that "".",15,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"But the problem is that when your life is in danger, when somebody is maybe attacking you and you don't know if they have a knife on them or a gun on them, when somebody pulls out a gun and you don't know whether or not they're actually willing to shoot, you are not.",16,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"when somebody is attacking maybe somebody else, there is an incredibly high degree of risk, fear and uncertainty in these situations.",17,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And it's not really sufficient to say: "" oh well this person could have fled. """,18,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"But they don't know that, for example, the person attacking you could be like: "" well, this person's gonna flee and get help and then I'm gonna be in trouble. """,19,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So they may be able do it like, they could attack you or things like that.",20,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Maybe then they could get away.,21,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And maybe if they stole something like significant from you, that's like really really bad for you and the police isn't going to be able to really do all that much.",22,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And that's besides the point that it's not like the police is necessarily going to be any more careful with another person's life anyway.,23,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So I don't even think it necessarily the assumption that creating limits on self defense is necessarily even going to decrease casualties given how careless police can often be with the lives of others.,24,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"So I'm not necessarily sure what exactly you can do to make the situation a whole lot better, but certainly you can't just limit people's rights to self defense when ultimately innocent people are gonna be put in danger the most as a result of that.",25,,
DJ_3198_self-defense_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So for those reasons don't limit self-defense rights.,26,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,We should ban home schooling because it does a lot of damage to children.,1,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"And I think that the biggest thing that we have to start off with is that any of the harms that come with home schooling, which I'll explain in a minute, it's important to put this in the context of choice and agency for the child.",2,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,Because when you're talking about home schooling this isn't something that kids have any reasonable degree of control over.,3,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,Parents obviously should have some degree of autonomy over how they wanna raise their child.,4,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"But when it comes to a very basic things, like the ability of a child to socialize, the ability of a child to get an education, the possibility of future success for that child, those are things that are going to affect the child to the rest of their life.",5,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,Well into their adulthood and beyond that.,6,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,So it's important to make sure that the best decision is being made on behalf of that child.,7,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,And I think that when it comes to home schooling that is almost never the best decision for that child.,8,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,So let's talk about reasons why this is the case.,9,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,So first there's social consequences to this and this is obvious.,10,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"You're first not really socializing with friends, you're less likely going to make human connections with people, so not having friends can be something that can be psychologically harmful to a lot of kids.",11,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,But beyond that you're also not learning how to socialize with adults outside of your family in the same way.,12,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,You're not interacting with teachers you're not interacting with other adults.,13,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,And all of those things can have profound consequences on later life.,14,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"They can have consequences on your ability to do basic things in the business world, obviously, like network, ability to connect with people, but beyond that they're also going to probably affect your ability to be satisfied and happy with your life.",15,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"Because you're not going to really develop a lot of social skills, you're not going to develop as many friendships, all things that are probably going to lead you being less happy, which is obviously not a good thing.",16,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"But beyond that, I also think that home schooling is going to have a direct consequence of your education.",17,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"Because by and large, professional teachers, people who actually get paid to teach are going to be able to do a better job than parents are going to be able to do, or some kind of like religious instructor or anything like that.",18,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"The by and large public schools or even a or private schools or whatever, like, but educational institutions are pretty effective in making it so that you actually learn various things.",19,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,And that's important because there's more qualified people.,20,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,But beyond that there's also something about learning in groups.,21,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"You learn it with you could do group projects, you learn teamwork, you learn all various kinds of skills.",22,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,And that's important because a lot of the work you're going to do in later life is going to be in the context of working with other people.,23,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"And if you're not able to like do like learn with other people like divide projects with other people, things like that, you're probably not going to get that far.",24,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"So you're not going to learn as many things that are going to be good, you're going to have a worse education and you're also going to miss out on skills that are uniquely important.",25,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,But finally I also think that it's important to look at the reality of why a lot of people choose to get home school.,26,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,And I think that a lot of parents choose to home school their children often to avoid giving them a legitimate education.,27,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"So whether it's trying to avoid trying to force on the child a religious education and then try to deprive them of the opportunity to have a public education because of that, whether it's someone who's like famous like a child celebrity, or whether it's like lavar ball who is playing lamelo ball out of high school, things like that.",28,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"Like usually these choices are being made for some kind of our religious reason, some kind of financial reason, but not necessarily because it's in the best interests of the child.",29,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,And I think that's a real problem because you should be able to just avoid school under the auspices of a of a home schooling education.,30,,
DJ_3204_homeschooling_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should ban home schooling.",31,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not fight illegal immigration because illegal immigration is absolutely fantastic, nothing wrong with it.",1,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by with an overview about this.,2,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,I think that legal immigration is far too restrictive.,3,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Legal immigration doesn't let in enough people to help our economy, it doesn't help in enough people from a humanitarian perspective, it doesn't let in enough refugees, it doesn't take in enough vulnerable people and it doesn't do so in a diverse enough way that helps a wide variety of people.",4,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So since the legal immigration is failing, and since by and large it restricts the abilities of people whether it's like for, whether it's family members or minors or simply people who are in vulnerable situations, who are being exploited, who want to make their better life somewhere else.",5,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And illegal immigration is by and large being used by good people who are in bad situations.,6,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So I don't really think that there's anything wrong with illegal immigration.,7,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"And I actually think that immigration, illegal or legal, can have a whole positive range of benefits for people.",8,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that a lot of this can start with the economy, which is probably popular amongst all people.",9,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"You look at people in america, for example, people who got people who got possible deportation deferred under the dream act, or doctor recipients in america, or people who are illegal immigrants, who grew up in america,",10,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"but they're still illegal immigrants and when they were given quasi-legal status they were able to become professors in universities, they could become doctors, they served, they could serve in the military, do all kinds of incredible things that really helped society, and all of these are good",11,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So when we're talking about illegal immigrants there's are really wrong and like horrible stereotype that it's just going to be people who don't want to bother learning english, people who are going to be on the bottom runs of society, people who commit crimes, people who have all these kind of like all these horrible stereotypes, when the reality couldn't be more different.",12,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"When the reality is that people who come to america to as immigrants oftentimes work harder than anyone else, are less likely to break the law than anyone else, and really want to do all they can to truly make a better lives for themselves and the people who come after them.",13,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And I also think they fill a need in a lot of ways.,14,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Because there's a lot of jobs that simply americans simply don't want to do.,15,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Things that don't pay well enough for a lot of americans that think is worth their time, are jobs that immigrants are willing to do.",16,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"And moreover, there's also a lot of immigrants who have really specialized skills, specialized talents, who aren't able to use those talents to help in their own countries oftentimes simply because maybe there isn't as much of a demand for certain kinds of like say technicians in like a developed developing country as there isn't silicon valley.",17,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Or maybe like there could be a whole variety of reasons.,18,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"But moreover, america often by and large has declining birth rates amongst like the average like white person who's lived here for a long time.",19,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"And minority groups and and immigrants in society are responsible in a lot of ways for increasing workforce, for making it so that the economy keeps growing year after year, which is also a good thing.",20,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,But there's also obviously just like a humane aspect of this.,21,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"People are coming from places where there's famine, where there's diseases, where there's war, where there's political religious or sexual persecution, and they want to come to america or other places in developed countries to make a better life for themselves.",22,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,When they often come with little money and an opportunity to change things.,23,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"It's just like a basic thing of empathy that for some reason some people lack, but is the basic thing that like you should do what you can to help people because it's the right thing to do.",24,,
DJ_3209_illegal-immigration_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons we should not fight illegal immigration, we should welcome illegal immigrants.",25,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not adopt teacher tenure reform because it would be really bad for teachers, for public education as a whole.",1,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So first why would it be bad for public education as a whole?,2,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Right now and it doesn't look like it's something that's going to change anytime soon because that's rather widespread and systematic, teachers are drastically underpaid, given the qualifications that they have to hold.",3,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"If you want to be a teacher you have to have a college degree, oftentimes if you want to be a teacher at like something other than like a preschool class or a kindergarten class, a lot of places want higher degrees as well.",4,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So if you want to be a high school chemistry teacher you probably need to have more specialized training on top of that.,5,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,All these things cost money.,6,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,All of these things mean that teachers have a lot of debt.,7,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,It means that teachers are very qualified and usually they take jobs out of the goodness of their heart or because they think these jobs are important and it's something that they want to do.,8,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"But that said, financial financial costs are very real costs and one of the biggest things is that if you're not going to be able to give teachers a whole lot of money, you can at least give them job security.",9,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Because job security is very important to people.,10,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Job security and stability means that you can plan your life because you know you're going to have your paycheck.,11,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,You know that you're not going to worry about getting fired like every every time you're up for a performance evaluation.,12,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Because for oftentimes reasons outside of your control, your students aren't able to perform as well as like the state wants them to perform, so you're not going to get screwed over because of that.",13,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"There's a whole lot of great things that come with job security, and it makes people more willing to get involved in a profession in the first place.",14,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And since there's like a real problem trying to attract teachers, I think that it's really important to make sure that job security is something that they keep.",15,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Otherwise who's going to want to be a teacher?,16,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"If you could just get fired constantly, if you have to pay a ton of money to be qualified to do it in the first place, and it doesn't really pay all that well.",17,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,It's just not going to work.,18,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,It'd be horrible it'd be catastrophic to public education.,19,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,But I also think that the status quo is just fine for teachers.,20,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Because there's a whole lot of like like like republicans like to make a big deal: "" oh well teachers, once they get tenure they can do whatever they want.",21,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"If you just not teach, and then like they won't be able to get fired. """,22,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And things like that, but that's really not actually the way that it works.",23,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,Because if you all you need is cause to fire somebody.,24,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And cause to fire somebody isn't all that hard to get.,25,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,If you want to fire someone you can find out how to fire somebody.,26,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"And what cause looks like is: if a teachers is just not doing their job, if the students are just like goofing off in class everyday, if a teacher just puts on videos all the time, and nothing is actually really happening in class, then obviously that's cause to fire a teacher and that's something that you can regulate.",27,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"But I think that by and large a lot of these cases are isolated, and they're used as examples to like wedge away like power from teachers.",28,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And that's a great problem.,29,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Because I think that another thing that teachers get a bad rep for are like the existence of their unions, things like teacher strikes and the like.",30,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,And job security and your ability to have tenure and not get fired arbitrarily is also important to accessing a lot of those other rights.,31,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,"Things like feeling comfortable going on strike but not getting fired, or things like that.",32,,
DJ_3212_teacher-tenure_con_WS_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should not adopt teacher tenure reform.,33,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,We should not fight global warming because global warming isn't really that big of a deal.,1,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"And because ultimately the sacrifices to our lifestyles that would be accompanied with actually fighting global warming are pretty major sacrifices that we shouldn't make people take if they don't want to take you, because people should be allowed to live their lives in different ways and, you know, not everyone likes having clean rivers or breathable air, things like that.",2,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, let's start by talking about why I think that global warming isn't actually that big of a deal.",3,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, the first reason for this is because a lot of things like, for example, the possibility of like food insecurity because food can't grow at certain temperatures or like changing weather patterns make farming and livability more difficult, all these kinds of things.",4,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,I think that a lot of these threats are incredibly overblown.,5,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,We already have things like we already have the ability to genetically engineer food.,6,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,We can make it grow in different temperatures.,7,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,We can build things like levees.,8,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,We know how to drain water.,9,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,We can rebuild we can build up barrier islands and things like that.,10,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"You can move to other places, like maybe some places are going to become more desert-like or too hot but other, colder places are going to become more livable.",11,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Like canada has more land than america does but you can't live in most of canada, things like that.",12,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So you can move to different places as they got warmer, things like that.",13,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"And the places that you can't exactly moved out of, like major cities, you just make protections for these kinds of things.",14,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,Obviously that's going to cost money.,15,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,I mean it's going to cost money to fight global warming too.,16,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"You're spending money either way, so you can spend money this way too.",17,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that this is a pretty reasonable way to to deal with global warming.,18,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So not so much preemptively fight global warming, but try to like deal with consequences of it.",19,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that that's much more fair, because fighting global warming would be incredibly, incredibly taxing on the way that we live our lifestyles.",20,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,Things like meat consumption probably would have to end outright.,21,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,We'd probably have to all be vegetarians to reasonably combat global warming.,22,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,We'd have to put extremely harsh limits on a lot of factories and things like that.,23,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,We'd have to make it it'd be a lot more expensive so a lot of cost of living would go up.,24,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"Public transportation would have to be completely redone in a lot of countries, like america.",25,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"These aren't things like eating or like power and electricity, like all of these things would have to be done in entirely different ways.",26,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,The technology doesn't really exist right now to do these kinds of things as effectively as we want to to scale.,27,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So, a lot of sacrifices to lifestyles would come.",28,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"And I think that's pretty bad because given that global warming, as I already proved isn't actually going to be that bad, why should we spend a whole lot of money or change all of our lifestyles on things that isn't going to be all that big of a deal?",29,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,It's like important to note that different people want to live their lives in different ways.,30,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,Some people don't want to give up eating meat and that's fine.,31,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,Some people think that polar bears are stupid.,32,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,Maybe they have the right to do that.,33,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_con_YBA_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, we should not fight global warming.",34,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"We should fight global warming, because global warming is bad, very very bad, and many many people are going to die, if we don't do something about it.",1,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"So, let's talk about why.",2,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"First and foremost, cities are going to flood.",3,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"When science has like it's like essentially just a scientific fact that, if the world keeps getting warmer, concentrated glaciers, polar ice caps, all these things are going to melt.",4,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"When it melts, it goes into the ocean, and when it goes into the ocean, sea levels rise.",5,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"Now this is a problem, because if sea levels go up by say five feet or ten feet, the billions of people, that live along coasts, are going to be under water, and that's a problem, because people are not fish and they cannot breathe underwater, they cannot live underwater.",6,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"So, this means that either you're going to have to spend whole like massive amounts of money on creating levees around essentially like the entire world, around like global coastlines, you're also going to have to spend a lot of money on maintaining those kind of things, and the like.",7,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"I think that's probably just gonna be prohibitively expensive for most people around the world, except for maybe the richest cities.",8,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"The other possibility is that everyone's going to have to move, which is also kind of a waste, because you built the entire cities there, but it's also very difficult to move, it's costly to move, it's expensive to move, there's transition cost, so all that's bad as well.",9,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"But the additional thing is that, a lot of these problems are going to happen not not just like over time gradually, but they're going to happen suddenly.",10,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,So you're not going to be able to transition as well.,11,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"So, for example, maybe the sea levels are already going up a little bit more and that means when a hurricane rolls around, a storm surge is going to be a whole lot worse and you're more likely going to have mass flooding or things like that.",12,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"or a levee crack, suddenly you're going to have like a bowl essentially fill up with water, which is awful, things like that.",13,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"This is also bad for global food supplies, most food can grow at the temperature that it's grown out for the entirety of human existence and natural existence, and if something gets five degrees warmer, or even two degrees warmer, food can't grow, and that's bad, because it's going to lead to mass starvation.",14,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"But similarly, to the last point, you're also going to see more volatility in global weather patterns, more natural disasters as a result of climate change, more unusual cold spells, more unusual hot spells, and things like that, and more extreme, so these are also just going to mess up crop production.",15,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,They're going to mess up the ability to actually feed people.,16,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"So, unless we plan on growing all of the global food supply inside greenhouses, which I don't think is in any way feasible, we should probably come with a solution to that, and fight global warming.",17,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"This is also going to be incredibly bad from just like a general health perspective, because even if, like, none of that is true, even if, like none of those like massive existential consequences are true as far as, like that's concerned, they're still obvious consequences.",18,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"like when you're releasing more CO two into the atmosphere, you are making it so that there is more air pollution and that could create problems for, like, a lung health and other kinds of health problems which aren't good, and other kinds of things.",19,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"But I also think that, as far as moral responsibility is concerned, that we have responsibilities for these things, because maybe you could have like a moral discussion.",20,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"okay, we know factually, global warming is going to exist, but there's a problem with that.",21,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,we'd have to spend a whole lot of money to fight global warming.,22,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,we'd have to drastically change our lives in order to fight global warming.,23,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"So, first and foremost, it's worth incurring these harms, because these harms are the risks are existential in nature, and spending money, or living a harder life, or a more less like wasteful life, are things that are more important.",24,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"Second, a lot of things are easy fixes: recycle more, have smarter regulations in place, are all things that don't necessarily require all that much of a transition, but third, it's incredibly irresponsible to young people, it's incredibly irresponsible to the people who have to live with the actual consequences of global warming, not like your racist sixty year old grandpa.",25,,
DJ_3223_global-warming_pro.trs.txt,"So, for all those reasons, we should fight global warming.",26,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"Boarding schools should be abolished because they're exclusionary, they deter social ability, and because they're quite bad for children as well and they allow parents to skirt their parental obligations.",1,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why boarding schools are bad for society.,2,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,Keep in mind that most boarding schools are expensive and prestigious institutions.,3,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,Like a lot of prominent examples are like eton in england.,4,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,Eton is known as like one of the like most like like the bougiest boarding schools in a world where like they send everyone to cambridge and oxford and other places like that.,5,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,You have places in america too that function in similar ways.,6,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,You have military academies that also do these kinds of things designed to instill these like archaic puritan era values into the youth and things like that and I think that in a lot of ways this is incredibly problematic because what they oftentimes amount to are essentially theater systems for the youth of aristocrats into the so called social elites in society.,7,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"And the way that this often works is that, if you had like- maybe family members who went these prestigious boarding schools, or you have- you're just someone who has a large degree of financial resources and can be a donor- you're able to secure spots in these, like prestigious high schools or middle schools or even lower schools and things like that, and this puts people at a disadvantage",8,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,It gives people a competitive advantage as far as getting into colleges and future earnings and things like that.,9,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,I think that it's very bad because it also takes away from investment in public schools and it takes away the need for wealthy people to be reliant on the public school system.,10,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,So it also makes it more likely that it's going.,11,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"the public school system is seen as almost a second or a lower class system rather than something that's supposed to serve the public, and I think that's a big problem and one of the biggest things that can keep social mobility evident in a society.",12,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"but the second reason why I think that boarding schools are very bad is I think that they're bad for children as well, and I think that they're bad in a couple of ways.",13,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"First, I think that they're bad in that they they harm the bond that children are supposed to have with their parents, and I think that the idea that you can just the bond- especially when you're growing up, the bond to the most important people in your life, that they can just like ship you off to a boarding school and leave you there, and that you're going to have the same kinds of experiences, the same kind of like emotional experiences and things like that, is absolutely ludicrous,",14,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,because when you go to places- especially like if it's like a military academy-,15,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"but most boarding schools are like this is well, things that are oftentimes evident there is, you're going to have rather restricted freedoms",16,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,you're going to be in dormitories full time that are going to be very strict.,17,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,you're not going to be able to have like all that much freedom to like go out and do things like that.,18,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,you're not going to be able to just like go out in the society and learn.,19,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,you're not going to be able to have the same experiences growing up with just like like friends and things like that- in like a normal environment.,20,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,It's oftentimes going to be seen as like a very isolating environment.,21,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,You're not going to get the same skills of interacting.,22,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"You're not going to be able to interact with your parents, who are supposed to be like, very, very important you and things like that.",23,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"and I think that all of these things deprive children of their childhoods in a lot of ways and can stunt their- like- emotional development and their social growth, which is just as important as any kind of academic or intellectual growth.",24,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"and this is also just a way for parents to skirt parental obligations, in that you can make raising your child essentially somebody else's problem, and I think that's ridiculous.",25,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"Like you could have kids are you cannot have kids that's your choice, but if you're going to have kids then you should be prepared to meet those obligations, to raise them, to be a constant influence in their lives not just send them out somewhere else and hope they're going to turn out okay.",26,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,I don't think that's a good way to actually effectively raise the future generation in society.,27,,
DJ_3225_boarding-schools_pro.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, boarding schools should be abolished.",28,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not abandon online dating because online dating is great for a whole lot of people and a lot of people enjoy it.,1,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why online dating works for a lot of people.,2,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because through traditional ways in which you meet people or without the internet or without any kind of online platform to connect with people, your meeting with people in the real world and that's something that a lot of people don't always want to do.",3,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,A lot of people don't enjoy going to bars.,4,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,A lot of people don't enjoy going to clubs.,5,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,A lot of people don't actively want to just go out into the and meet with a bunch of strangers in a place that they don't know or a place they may not be as comfortable.,6,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,A lot of people just don't like that and that's for good reasons.,7,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And especially when you're talking about having like a relationship with somebody, you're dating somebody, these are probably pretty important things.",8,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"If you're the kind of person who doesn't like going to clubs, your you may, your probably going to the people that you may meet in clubs and things like that may not be the kind of people that you actually want to date.",9,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And online dating can provide a pretty good solution for that.,10,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because there's so many people, because you get an alternative platform to meet people and because it creates, like, essentially, a profile where you can learn a couple of things about someone- their basic personality, traits and things like that- before you actually meeting with someone or before you're even talking to somebody.",11,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"it gives you more of a grounding idea of what you're actually going to know about this person, rather than just seeing somebody in the club or something like that.",12,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that's a lot better.,13,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But it's also good in terms of access.,14,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because a lot of people are like awkward, or you're just not comfortable going up to somebody in a club or in a bar and talking to somebody.",15,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And a lot of online dating gives more of a solves a lot of these problems by first just sheer level of access to a lot of people, some of whom are going to be much more similar to you, and second by like matching you with a person.",16,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So you're already going to have a basis of things to discuss.,17,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,A basis of similarity which is also helpful.,18,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And a lot of those things are probably going to make your dating experience enjoyable, they're probably going to make your dating experience better, which is all good things.",19,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,The next thing that I want to talk about though is that I think that this is also probably helpful in terms of like safety in terms of dating.,20,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because, like I said, when the alternative is you're meeting people in a club or at a bar or something like that and outside, the first time that you're meeting somebody, you're meeting somebody in possibly an unfamiliar space and it's somebody that you really don't know, you know almost nothing about, while when it's, when it's online dating, you don't have to meet somebody ever.",21,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"if you do meet them at, you don't have to meet them ever.",22,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And if you do meet someone it's only going to be by choice, after sufficient discussion with somebody via like a digital connection.",23,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So there's less of an ability to harm somebody.,24,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And you're more likely to feel comfortable with that person because you've already talked to that person for a while, you probably know a little bit more about that person and you take more time to like get to know somebody.",25,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that it's probably good on the safety front too.,26,,
DJ_3235_online-dating_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, we should not abandon online dating.",27,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not fight for palestinian independence because palestinian independence would necessarily come at the expense of israeli security and israelis viability is a state and it would also require unseemly and unnecessary sacrifices on the part of israel.,1,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So let's start by grounding this a little bit and talking about why in general israel is clearly in the right in the palestinian israeli conflict and therefore it shouldn't really make any concessions that are unnecessary in terms of its security or in terms of concessions like say giving up east jerusalem, the right of return or etcetera etcetera.",2,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So the biggest reason is that palestinians have had numerous opportunities to come to the negotiating table and have peace with israelis.,3,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And this has been the case throughout many many decades, where you start from the very first when the UN proclamation that created the separations of palestine in israel.",4,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Palestine had way more land than israel did, to the point where israel wasn't even a continuous state.",5,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It had to separate parts.,6,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And then that wasn't good enough for palestine and like eight other arab countries, so they decided to invade israel.",7,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And lo and behold, israel wins that war, and then you fast forward over the next forty years or so and though every decade or so, whether it's on a jewish holiday in yom kippur or in like the middle of june, arab countries in palestinian allies decide to invade israel every once in a while and they kept losing.",8,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And it's pretty much their their fault that they're in the situation that they're in right now.,9,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,They kept trying to take more more land from israel.,10,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Throughout most of the history of the conflict palestinian leaders weren't even willing to accept israel's right to exist as a state.,11,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"It wasn't until the oslo accords in like the nineties when yasser arafat gave up that concession, the concession of israel literal existence.",12,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So realistically our sympathy should be limited.,13,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So now let's talk about why israel's israeli sacrifices.,14,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So fighting for a palestinian independence would be really bad for advancing israeli causes, which is bad because they're in the right.",15,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So first it would be a security hazard for israel.,16,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,The biggest reason and the obvious reason is that this would just give hamas the ability to basically do whatever the hell it wanted in the gaza strip.,17,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like if palestine is its own state, you are not gonna have a blockade on it.",18,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,that would be like an act of war.,19,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"so, unless you're gonna perpetually be at war with the newly independent state- which seem like a pointless and stupid idea and like like against the purposes of giving them statehood in the first place- then like you have to do all tons of stuff like lifting blockades, lifting restrictions, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.",20,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So you're probably not gonna be very good for israeli security.,21,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like if you think like iran and turkey and saudi arabia and whoever trying to like ship weapons into like various palestinian terrorist organizations now, well just wait till what happens when israel has a nonexistent security presence in those parts.",22,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So like there's probably not gonna be all that much there and that's gonna be really bad.,23,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But it's further bad because it legitimizes that acts of terrorism, literally the murder of civilians is a legitimate way to extract concessions from a state, which is ridiculous.",24,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Like they would be like saying that like nine eleven when it happened to america is like legitimate grounds for america start giving concessions to like al qaida or the taliban or whatever.,25,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It's just like it's absolutely ridiculous.,26,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,But the final thing is that it would be unfair concessions on the part of israel and what they would have to give up.,27,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Palestinians are asking for too much.,28,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"They're demanding like a right of return, they are demanding east jerusalem, they're demanding millions of settlements beat dismantled, most if not all of which are pretty much unreasonable.",29,,
DJ_3238_palestinian-independence_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons don't fight for palestinian independence.,30,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,Right of asylum is not absolute because security threats can override the right to asylum and economic welfare concerns of your own people can also override asylum concerns.,1,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,So I want to first talk about the burden that the other the opposition team has in this round because it's important to note that absolute means that defending that the right of asylum being absolute means that you have to take in everyone and that this is a hard and fast legal principle that is unshakable.,2,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"So if we show you that in some circumstances it is important to not respect the right of asylum, not in all cases but in some cases, then this means that the right of asylum is not.",3,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about the security concerns.,4,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"I think that there's obviously a lot of important security concerns you could have particularly when you're talking about asylum because while it's unfortunate, a lot of the people who are seeking asylum may not have a whole lot of ways in which they can actually prove that they are in a security threat.",5,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"A lot of the ways in which of like prior employment records, birth certificates, organizations you may or you may have been a part of, things like that.",6,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,Basic elements of background checks to ensure security.,7,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"a lot of these things become, and this documentation becomes hard to obtain if you live in a post war, if you live in like a war torn society, and all these things are unfortunate.",8,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"security checks are nevertheless important because even if it's only a couple of people amongst the millions of people that you would admit were the like that are going to be a problem, the result is oftentimes far worse.",9,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"First, because if there's one security breach that could lead to a bombing which results in dozens, maybe even hundreds of casualties, that's something that's very, very bad and that's something that the state has a duty to prevent.",10,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"but additionally, I think that oftentimes, because of the nature of these security breaches, when they do occur, you often see a sensationalization of the problems, in that you see the pendulum swing in the opposite direction, that immigrants and other groups are oftentimes treated even worse.",11,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,So it's better for everyone that security checks are very strong and maintained heavily in place.,12,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,But the second thing I want to talk about is about economic welfare concerns.,13,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,Obviously the right of welfare can't be absolute because some states just don't have the money to support asylum seekers.,14,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"Keep in mind that when you're coming from like a war torn society seeking asylum, oftentimes it can be very difficult for you.",15,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"You may have to learn a new language, you have to get maybe new job training, you may need access to various social support services.",16,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"These are all things that cost money and especially if you're doing this in an absolute way where you're taking in everyone who wants to come in, who is eligible for asylum, this could be a whole lot of people and that's a big problem because a lot of states just may not have the money to pay for these things.",17,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,So this could mean that you're going to be having people who are going to be neglected and not being taken care of and I think that's like quite bad.,18,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"But I also think that a lot of states have, the other hand, a lot of unemployment problems and that, like large kicks in immigration can lead to a certain degree of job displacement.",19,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"and oftentimes this is bad,",20,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"because when you're making, as a state, a decision, you have to prioritize the economics, security and economic stability of your own people,",21,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"because those are the people who pay taxes, those are the people who you have a duty to, those are the people who give the government the legitimacy in the",22,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,first place and that's who the government is ultimately supposed to serve,23,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,"So while obviously we have certain moral and humanitarian obligations, these obligations cannot be so absolute that they outweigh the basic duties whether it's for security or a calm economic welfare that you're going to have to your own people first and foremost.",24,,
DJ_323_asylum_pro.trs.txt,So for those reasons the right of asylum is not absolute.,25,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,We should keep sanctions and use them when necessary.,1,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by grounding what this is discussion about.,2,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Because this isn't a discussion about whether sanctions are always the best solution to some kind of international problem or some kind of problem that you're having with a specific country.,3,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,The way that this makes sense is whether or not you should stop using sanctions entirely.,4,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So this is really a discussion about whether or not you should even have sanctions as like a tool in the toolbox of of methods essentially for international enforcement of norms our laws or things like that.,5,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"So given that, let's talk about why sanctions are definitely a tactic that you should consider using as a country and keep having them.",6,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So the first is that they're just effective.,7,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Oftentimes sanctions are one of the best ways to get your point across.,8,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like a big example of this most recently is you look at countries like iran, where through the use of sanctions and international cooperation you're able to stop the stop like essentially nuclear armament in a lot of ways by iran, and make it so that they're not really going to be able to actively develop a nuclear weapon in any meaningful capacity.",9,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"And those kinds of things are incredibly big international accomplishments, because they come peacefully.",10,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,And that's obviously something that's very good and a big part of its efficacy.,11,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"But also, a big reason why they work is because money talks incredibly loudly and it does this in a couple of ways: first in terms of the way in which it affects the elites in a country.",12,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Oftentimes countries are run by elites.,13,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"Whether those elites are monarchs, like in a country like saudi arabia, or in a country like iran, where you or or like somewhere like russia, where you have business interests, you have like the oligarchs essentially that have tons and tons of money and want to like make more money off their investments and things like that.",14,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So obviously sanctions affect their ability to make a profit because you're not able to do business with a lot of corporations oftentimes if your country is getting sanctioned.,15,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"You're not able to make money, you're not able to enjoy a lot of like the fruits of your wealth and a lot of ways.",16,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So that's why for example people like putin care a whole lot about getting american sanctions taken off russia.,17,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"Because it hurts putin's bottom line, it hurts a lot of his the elites party line.",18,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Another way in which economic sanctions are incredibly effective is the pressure they put on populations domestically to try to force change.,19,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,And I think a lot of ways this is also something that we saw in places like iran.,20,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"It's also certainly something that has been used in saudi arabia before, where when the population wants some kind of change and wants concessions from leadership, oftentimes these concessions come in the form of financial payouts, whether in the form of like more expensive welfare systems, or government services and goods.",21,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"Like in saudi arabia population, or in places like iran, where the opposite, where the lack of basic goods and services, or the increase in price of basic goods and services, as a consequence of international sanctions, puts pressure to on the leadership in order to encourage change.",22,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So oftentimes this is a big reason why sanctions can be incredibly effective.,23,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"Money talks, people want money, people want like things and services in their lives.",24,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,But the final thing is that sanctions are obviously just better than the alternatives.,25,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,"They're peaceful, they don't cause war so you're not like you're not directly killing people on the other side of the in the country, you're not putting your own people's lives in danger and your own military, and you're not also risking consequences of an ever worsening conflict by like an invasion or something like that.",26,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,Kinda like what we see in places like iraq or afghanistan.,27,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_con_SSH_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should definitely keep sanctions.,28,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,We should end the use of economic sanctions because they're ineffective and they ultimately only hurt the people themselves and they don't actually hurt or change the policies of the people in power.,1,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by why sanctions are an ineffective means and they only just hurt people.,2,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"So, for starters, they're designed to change the actions of leaders.",3,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,Oftentimes they're targeting autocrats or dictators or single party governments.,4,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,They're oftentimes not targeting democratic societies or at least when western countries use them.,5,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"And this is important because this means you're trying to attack single leaders or unelected groups in power that are, in a lot of ways, unaccountable.",6,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,So these people aren't really going to actually struggle when you put economic sanctions on them.,7,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,These people who are occupying immense degrees of privilege because they literally control entire countries are always going to have access to black markets and they're always going to have access to other actors who are similarly sanctioned.,8,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"So you put sanctions on north korea, it does trade with china.",9,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"You put sanctions on russia, it can do trade with like anyone else maybe iran or something.",10,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"You put sanctions on iran, it can do trade with russia and north korea.",11,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"You put sanctions on cuba, it can do trade with literally anyone else in the world.",12,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"You put sanctions on venezuela, you're in the same boat.",13,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,Pretty much like any country that you put sanctions on it's always going to have access to other countries.,14,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,And that's a big problem because it's an inherent loophole in the way sanctions work.,15,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"Sanctions only work if literally everybody is cooperating, if everybody is on the same page.",16,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,And this is something that almost never happens because there's always going to be disagreements in the ideologies that are underpinning the the use of the sanction in the first place.,17,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,So you're probably not going to be all that effective.,18,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,What is going to be effective?,19,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,The ability of the average person in that country to access goods and services.,20,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"So while US sanctions on a place like venezuela or cuba isn't actually going to affect the people at the very top, it's probably going to at minimum make the cost of goods more expensive because it's maybe going to have to come from actors that are farther away, actors that don't have the ability to produce things as cheaply, etcetera.",21,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,Maybe there's also certain kinds of goods and services that are uniquely produced by america or could be like done cheaper for america by america or other kinds of countries that are putting the sanctions on you and that's going to be a struggle.,22,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"So for example, you see in places like venezuela where there's a huge shortage of all kinds of supplies because american companies that supply a vast majority of like products to the world whether it's like like sanitary supply like procter and gamble, johnson and johnson, like things that like basic things like that which are essentially not available in places like venezuela.",23,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,Cause you put sanctions on them or inability to access like say american products.,24,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"That's not going to hurt the people at the very top, it's going to hurt people on the ground.",25,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"Same in north korea, when you make it so that there's no businesses in north korea, I don't think kim jong un's life is going to get any worse, he's going to do whatever the hell he wants.",26,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,Who's going to be hurt is the people whose economy is going to be a whole lot worse.,27,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,And that brings me to the next argument about why sanctions are ineffective.,28,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"I think that they're only going to serve to make the people's lives worse and they're going to look at the people who are making their lives worse, namely the west or the person who's putting the sanction on them in the first place, and this is only going to further support for the government in the first place.",29,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"Because oftentimes these autocrats come into power and they're seen as like great they're seen as like protectors of a certain group, they're it's oftentimes an underpinning of like nationalist blood in soil tendencies that push autocrats and dictators and like people like that into power in the first place.",30,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"So like, like, so, like the like kim dynasty comes into power during the korean war, after the united states drops, like like, thousands of tons of napalm on their cities and they're burning to the ground and then, obviously, like the kim dynasty oppresses the people of north korea.",31,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,"but the fact that they that, the fact that, like- whether in this case not military damage, but economic damage, the fact that economic damage is coming at the hand of a western country, makes it more likely that you're only going to see support for regimes in the first place and their power being further in locked.",32,,
DJ_3263_economic-sanctions_pro.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should end sanctions.,33,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not limit the internet of things because the internet of things is generally really good.,1,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It makes people's lives easier and at that it's a choice that people make.,2,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So and it's a legitimate choice so you should limit people's choice.,3,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why the internet of things is just and actively good thing.,4,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that the reasons for this are very obvious.,5,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,The reason why these technologies are being invented in the first place and like millions and millions of dollars is being invested into these new market products is that people think that it's gonna be useful.,6,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,People think it's going to be useful to have technology and the internet integrating everything from your car to your refrigerator to your watch to your phone to your TV.,7,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And it's true, these things do make everything easier.",8,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Like are really basic example is I want to watch TV I want to watch like some kind of basketball game on my TV.,9,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But since I'm a young millennial and I don't pay for cable because cable is stupid, I want to just like get individual things that I want that I can watch on the internet, which is oftentimes free.",10,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So how do I get that on to my TV?,11,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Well, if you have like a smart TV you could just like go on the internet on your TV.",12,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Or same if you have like a playstation or something like that.,13,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Or similarly, if you have like a car, especially in the future when we are self driving cars, and you're going to need to integrate things like say google maps navigation maybe, other kinds of things, there's all kinds of ways in which like your life can just be made easier by the existence of the internet of things.",14,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"When like all of these things are connected, when you're not like constantly log in and out of every individual advice, when you can like communicate with different advices, when if you're doing something on your phone and then suddenly you wanna like do something on your computer, like those things are gonna be connected.",15,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So like it's like the same concept with like something like google drive, where if you're like editing something in one location you don't wanna have to like be back in the old days where you need like to just like email everything and upload it and then download it, now you can just like do it on the cloud.",16,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Like things like that which just like generally make your life easier and much better.,17,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So all of that's going to be great.,18,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But the additional layer of argument here is that people make choices as to partake in the internet of things.,19,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,People do not have to like obviously in many cases the internet isn't really optional nowadays.,20,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like you have to use things like email at work, you realistically if you wanna like a find things in general you probably need to use the internet.",21,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But the internet of things itself as like in a as an entire entity is definitely not mandatory.,22,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Like there's definitely many things that you don't have to participate in.,23,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,If you don't wanna have like a smart refrigerator then just don't get a smart refrigerator.,24,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,If you don't want a smart TV?,25,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Don't get a smart TV.,26,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"If you don't want an apple watch then just don't, then get like a regular watch.",27,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,There's all kinds of ways in which like it's obvious that like you don't have it's not like coercive in the same way that internet access general is.,28,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So like any risks or any problems that may arise from the internet of things, whether it's like dependency or security or anything like that, it's important to recognize that these are all by choice, and that people can just like: "" wait, well this may have some kind of risk but it makes my life easier in this other way. """,29,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And that's a choice that people are perfectly capable and rational of making.,30,,
DJ_3265_iot_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should not limit the internet of things.,31,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,We should limit the internet of things because the internet of things has it'll have an incredibly dangerous impact on our lives in a lot of ways if we don't have sensible regulation.,1,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"There's been a whole great deal of technological progress over the past couple of decades, to the point where, in a lot of ways, the fabric of society in our culture is completely changing at a faster pace than ever before.",2,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"given the forces of technology, and I think in a lot of ways, we're not prepared for it at the start, we want to.",3,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,I want to talk about cyber security,4,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"because I think in a lot of ways, the internet is incredibly unsafe and that a lot of your data is incredibly unsafe, and the premier example of this is like, throughout the past year, there's been a a a great number of high profile hacking incidents, whether it's like equifax getting hacked or other similar attacks that were employing the use of ransomware",5,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"By and large, these tools and tactics that were being used were as a result of literally the CIA getting hacked and CIA hacking tools getting released to basically the entire internet, which kind of presents a problem when, like in theory,",6,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"one of the most advanced hacking like public agencies in the world- like in theory the CIA probably has pretty good cyber security if they can't even protect their own systems- and the tools they use to attack like people and corporations and governments, then got released the entire internet",7,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"that was a big part of why we went from seeing run of the mill hacking to, more recently, much more widespread hacking.",8,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,Obviously there's other high profile examples too like russia hacking.,9,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,Like the united states literally hacking US elections and hacking the emails of like political parties.,10,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,Horrible things that prove that the internet just is not secure and I think in a lot of ways the internet of things make that worse.,11,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,It is going to centralize your life into single locations.,12,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"so when all of these devices- your car, your phone, your, your refrigerator- are all connected into a single server, you're the it's.",13,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"you're much more likely to be vulnerable because, rather than having to break into each one of those individual things to get access to personal information, instead of having to break into your car and your house and your refrigerator and your phone, they now only after break into like one centralized location.",14,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,I think in addition to that obviously just the greater number of things on the internet just creates more vulnerability so that's the second thing.,15,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,But third and foremost I also think that there is more likely going to be quality distinction from cyber security.,16,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"so it's like, for example, you could maybe look at like password, like encryption on websites where, like by and large, if you like, were to call like if I have my like, I have a password with IBM and I call IBM customers support, I probably can't just be like, hey, I want you to reset my password for me,",17,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,because IBM will presumably say we don't have your password,18,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,it comes it like it's encrypted and like we don't.,19,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,we don't have access to these kinds of things.,20,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"But there's probably a good deal of websites, maybe like shadier parts of the internet, especially if you're like not as informed about things, where maybe these things like are just like sitting around.",21,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,and this could be the same with various devices where there's going to be quality distinctions.,22,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,there's not gonna be necessarily quality common controls on these kind of things to make sure that it's going to be safe.,23,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"But the next thing is also just like an issue of like privacy and autonomy because besides all of those things, besides like hacking and things like that there's also a privacy risk in corporations.",24,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"Corporations being able to sell data on you, information on your identity on literally every aspect of your life what you eat, how you sleep, how you drive, how you walk.",25,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,Corporations can sell that to basically anyone who wants that information and that's important because that's can be like like your online identity in a lot of ways nowadays encompasses a huge amount of your identity.,26,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,The final argument is I think that this is going to be really bad for user experience as well.,27,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"I'm imagining a future in which toyota makes a multi-billion dollar contract to use apple maps instead of google maps because apple pays them more and that really sucks for me if I have a toyota car because I think google maps is better and all kinds of like technological implications, proprietary software implications that are probably not going to be all that great.",28,,
DJ_3265_iot_pro.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, we should limit the internet of things.",29,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,We should not protect edward snowden because what edward snowden did is bad and because it would set a bad precedent to legitimize the actions that edward snowden.,1,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what he specifically did is bad.,2,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,I think that mass surveillance is by and large something that was already well known by most of the population.,3,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"It's something that in the wake of nine eleven we legitimized, we knew the government the government was already spying on people, and we knew that it was doing this because we want to deter terrorist attacks.",4,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Obviously the government when it's collecting its meta data and things like that can't use that to charge the average person with any kind of crime.,5,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,It's not going to use that and give it to the local police department by you.,6,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"They're using this for pretty high level stuff for terrorist activity, for threats to national security.",7,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So by and large the average american doesn't really have anything to hide unless you're like a terrorist or you're doing or you're threatening to like like kill a whole lot of people.,8,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,You probably don't have to worry about actually getting affected by government surveillance.,9,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that the privacy rights violation that was taking place here it seems worse than it does.,10,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,It seems bad because a lot of data is getting collected but in matters like what that data is being used for and how it's being used and you can obviously have safeguards and acceptable uses for that data.,11,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,You can make sure that there is constitutional requirements that are in place so that you can't use it in like some kind of district or local court or for some kind of local crime.,12,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,You could only use it for threats to national security.,13,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So I don't think like it really was a whole good thing where there was all this leaking of government secrets, leaking of how governments were collecting data and what they were doing with this data and things like that.",14,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,It makes it more difficult for governments to do their job and protect people from terrorism which really isn't good.,15,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"But beyond that, I also think this is a bad precedent because this was essentially a violation of government secrecy laws, leaking state secrets and the only reason some people think is okay is because of political reasons.",16,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,People think that oh well I agree politically that the state shouldn't be spying on me.,17,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,I think that this is illegitimate.,18,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So I'm glad that somebody broke the law to give me that information.,19,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,But the problem is is that that's not the way the law works.,20,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,The law has to exist across different circumstances.,21,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,It shouldn't be just like you can't have the law tailored to individual context in all these ways because it means that you're probably going to get unjust and unequal outcomes where depending on the popularity of some kind of topic or action you're going to see people get punished in wildly different ways for literally doing the same thing.,22,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So maybe next time somebody's going to instead of leaking something that hurts national security in terms of like spying operation, maybe somebody's going to leak something about troop movements.",23,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Maybe somebody's going to leak details about like weapons or development or these kinds of things that are much more contentious politically.,24,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"But that doesn't actually change the underlying wrong, the underlying legal violation that took place which is outing state secrets.",25,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,That's like simply not an acceptable thing that we can allow to do if we value keeping governments and national security safe.,26,,
DJ_3278_snowden_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, don't protect edward snowden.",27,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,We should protect edward snowden because edward snowden did an incredibly valuable public service and it took a great deal of self sacrifice having to leave the country he grew up in behind in order to really deeply help the people in that country.,1,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"So let's start by talking about why what he blew the whistle on is absolutely abhorrent and is something the government should have never been doing in the first place and certainly non-secret and then second, why it was necessary for him to take the actions that he took and circumvent like traditional like avenues of like essentially whistle blow illegally.",2,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about what exactly he did.,3,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,Obviously he uncovered a huge mass of national security surveillance.,4,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,A large deal of which the public wasn't really aware of and I think that this is inherently bad because there's a reason why we have several amendments in the US constitution that explicitly protect people's privacy in different ways.,5,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,Whether it's like freedom against searches and seizure or other kinds of things.,6,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,It's always been a right.,7,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,the right to privacy has always been,8,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"one of the most important things in america and certainly a lot of our jurisprudence upholds this idea, and the reason for that is just",9,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"because people have the right to have like their own identity, basically, and control what people know about them, what people can possibly harass them based on and what people, how people are going to live their lives, and when the government has essentially like near infinite information on every single person in society, that creates like a huge problem and a lot of ways, it's like a surveillance state type",10,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"that is really really eerie and spooky in that the government would be able to monitor you at all times, know where you're going at all times, know everything that you're doing at all times, and these are things that certainly the government just should not know about you.",11,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,The government shouldn't know where you are every minute of the day.,12,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"The government shouldn't know who you're talking to every minute of the day because people should have the expectation of privacy, people being able to like keep communications like maybe between people who are close to them or business communications are all of these things private.",13,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"But beyond just like the fact that the government shouldn't have this information in the first place, the fact that the government is collecting all this information one place is an absolutely horrible and stupid idea especially in relation to cybersecurity.",14,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,So what would be easier?,15,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"Let's say that you want to get every single person in america so you want to get half of americans of a hundred forty million or so security numbers, what do you do if you want a hundred and forty million security numbers?",16,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,Do you hack equifax or do you hack a hundred and forty million people's individual computers and try to get those security numbers?,17,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,You're probably going to do the first one because that just makes way more sense because you're you're only having to do the thing once.,18,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,You're getting all that massive data at once that's more useful.,19,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"So when the government just compiles all of this sensitive information people's like phone like like records from like internet like transaction like basically like anything that you do that leaves some kind of a digital footprint, the government tries to illicitly collect data on, creates something that's incredibly vulnerable to hackers because the government certainly can't keep itself safe from hackers.",20,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,The CIA is getting hacked for christ sake.,21,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,Beyond that it's also a big problem that there was never sufficient public discussion about this.,22,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"There was never really consent to this, in that the people never really knew the extent to which the government was actually watching them, and the fact that there was",23,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"so much uproar afterwards, the fact that the CI, that the fact that the NSC, an, the CIA and all these other agencies had pressure put on them to try to change some of the tactics they're doing to make it at least a little bit better, shows how upset people were at what was happening",24,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,That people didn't know that was happening in the first place.,25,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,That brings us to the final thing which is why was necessary that edward snowden did this?,26,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,"Politicians didn't care, the people didn't know, and this was keep going to happen again and again for who knows how long.",27,,
DJ_3278_snowden_pro.trs.txt,Edward snowden took a stand and for those reasons we should protect him.,28,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Israel should not end the blockade of the gaza strip and it shouldn't do it because it's absolutely vital for security purposes that they keep this blockade up.,1,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So ending the blockade means completely abandoning the security measures that are currently in place that restrict the movement of goods into gaza.,2,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Maybe israel could take some measures to ease the blockade, maybe they could allow in more it could let in more humanitarian goods or it can allow more staffers for the blockade so that way humanitarian aid things like that get processed quickly and are not just sitting at checkpoints for long periods of time.",3,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Uf it could take measures maybe to ease access and things like that but the blockade itself I think is absolutely vital to israeli security.,4,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's talk about first and foremost why this is true.,5,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Obviously right now israel isn't actually at war with any countries in the middle east.,6,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"It's not a war with lebanon, it's not war with iran or saudi arabia or egypt or any of these countries israel even has to a certain extent alliances with some countries now in the middle east.",7,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,The greatest threat to israel's security and what actually results in the majority of israeli deaths nowadays is terrorist attacks and more so than that terrorist attacks that often are originating out of the gaza strip and the west bank.,8,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So why do you need to make sure that the west that the gaza strip is being blockaded?,9,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Because there's actors around the world that are willing to give give hamas like the predominant terrorist organization that exists is like essentially a government in the gaza strip weapons.,10,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Iran is willing to give them rockets, turkey is willing to give them weapons, governments around the middle east like are willing to both openly and covertly give weapons to hamas that are knowingly going to be used against israeli civilians.",11,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So obviously that's just wholly unacceptable to israel.,12,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Israel cannot allow weapons to flow into the gaza strip without any kind of checks against this and there's no reason to think that this won't happen.,13,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,There's governments that are willing to do that clearly hamas wants to like keep bombing israel because that's just like kind of what they do.,14,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So there's no real reason to think that if you end the blockade that's suddenly going to result in like an easing of terms.,15,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,You're probably still going to see like a terrorist organization still wanting to commit acts of terrorism now it's just going to be more able to do so.,16,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But I also think that we should look into some of the comparative as for what are the actual costs of the blockade because at the end of the day I think that they're rather small.,17,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,I think that sometimes people overblow the political problems the blockade has cost for israel.,18,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,ending the blockade isn't going to stop people from protesting israel.,19,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,it's not going to make BBS go away.,20,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"it's not going to make other kinds of anti israel organizations ease up, because it's not that they're like mad about the boycott.",21,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,that's just one of the things they're mad about.,22,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,They're mad about basically everything that israel does.,23,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,they're mad about the fact that there's no statehood.,24,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,they're mad about the fact that israel forced palestinians off their land.,25,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"they're mad about the fact that, like, there's no right of return.",26,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"they're mad about the fact that, like there's not sufficient spending that's going into, like a lot of like areas in gaza strip and the west bank.",27,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"they're mad that, like, civilian targets dying bombed.",28,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,they're mad about like a literally a billion things.,29,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,They're so I don't really think it is meaningful to say just because you end the one thing you end the blockade you're really going to see any kind of meaningful progress.,30,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"You're not going to see international political norms change, you're not going to see anti israeli actors change you're certainly not going to see hamas get any nicer you're not really going to see the west bank change it's like change all that much because it's kind of disconnected from hamas by and large right now.",31,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,You're really not going to see all that much change so there's really no reason why you should bother lifting the blockade.,32,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"It's necessary for safety, and you're not really going to get all that much change.",33,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So we're all those reasons, don't end the blockade.",34,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"We should end the blockade on the gaza strip because it ultimately doesn't really actually solve all that much and it does more than harm does more harm than any real good for everything from the peace process to international perceptions of israel, and it's also immoral.",1,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why it doesn't work.,2,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,The biggest reason why it doesn't work is pretty obvious: it's not like there's a shortage of terrorist attacks in israel and this blockade has been happening for almost a decade now.,3,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,It's not like hamas isn't firing rockets every day.,4,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,It's not like hamas isn't having terrorists going on to buses and bomb people or stab people or do all these kinds of things.,5,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,It's not like there's still a very real threat of terrorist attacks that is happening in israel oftentimes.,6,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"So it's so it's very clear that if the blockade is working at all for funneling supplies in, clearly it's only doing so much given that illicit black market supplies and bombs and weapons and guns are still finding their way into hamas and other kinds of militant terrorist organizations' hands in in the gaza strip.",7,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"So you already probably should end something that isn't working because you're probably as the israeli government spending a whole lot of political capital and money on doing this kind of a blockade, but the picture is even more dire than that.",8,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"Because I think that you're because I think that the when you actually look at the way the gaza strip blockade works, it's incredibly restrictive.",9,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,And it's very restrictive in the way in which a whole lot of supplies really aren't able to find their way into the gaza strip.,10,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,And this is why you oftentimes see things like shortage of like medical supplies or humanitarian supplies and things like that.,11,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"And even when these things do ultimately find their way into gaza, the blockade drastically slows the process of getting them in and constricts the supply that's able to get in, and it oftentimes also suplics the countries that are able to get it in.",12,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,So let's say like if you're iran you're probably not going to be able to give humanitarian aids to poor people on the ground in gaza even if you'd like to do that.,13,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"So it like does things like it artificially restricts the ability of people in gaza, who are a ton of people who are innocent civilians, for actually getting help.",14,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"So that creates a really really big problem for numerous reasons: first, it's kind of immoral and it's immoral because it results in people dying.",15,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,Most people don't die from israeli drone strikes or israeli like targeted strikes on like where things hamas terrorists are.,16,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"Most of the time people are dying because of like starvation, complications from health problems, a lack of access to food, like there's all kinds like those are the primary lack of like basic sanitation things like that, the fact that there's no electricity, the fact that you probably aren't able to work, like like a full time job because of all this instability.",17,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,Like these are the real reasons why there's so many problems in the gaza strip.,18,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,And those things are much more directly tied to things like a blockade than they are to anything else.,19,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,And that creates a spillover problem because the reason why you could have a blockade for ten years and not see any fucking progress is because you're doing the same thing over and over again and you're still going to have people suffering and when people are suffering they're more likely to be violent.,20,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"Because when you're unemployed, when you, or when you see, like, when you're not able to like support your family, when you see, like, your friends around you dying, when you see all of these bad things happening to you and when, on the basic level, you're able to like, look it israel as this evil other,",21,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"because they literally put walls around you and restrict your movement, restrict your ability to do anything, no matter who you are, just based on the where you, just based on where you're born",22,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"this probably pretty understandably, creates a lot of negative impressions for people that are living in gaza.",23,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,So this is why it's so easy for hamas to use propaganda to keep recruiting more and more terrorists that keep doing terrorist attacks over and over again.,24,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,There's never going to be a shortage as long as the conditions on the ground are ripe to have an existence of terrorism in the first place.,25,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"But finally, even if none of that matters, this hurt israel's international perceptions which is way more.",26,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"It makes it so that boycott divestment sanctions is going to be more powerful because it's going to create more of a like people are going to hate israel more, it's going to create more political problems for israel, it's going to create long term economic problems for israel and it's going to keep being a financial drain for israel as well.",27,,
DJ_3279_gaza-strip_pro.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, you should probably and the blockade of the gaza strip.",28,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,Eco tourism is good and we should increase it.,1,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,And the biggest reason we should increase it is because it's incredibly helpful for the conservation movement and for it's good for the environment.,2,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,And secondarily we should increase it because it's just an enjoyable alternative way to tour compared more traditional ways.,3,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,So let's start by why it's good for conservation and why that's important.,4,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,Obviously the environment is important.,5,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,We all live in the environment.,6,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"If the environment is destroyed were probably a pretty big trouble, and we rely pretty heavily on the environment.",7,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"We rely heavily on the ability to have clean air, we rely on a livable environment that isn't destroying us via like natural disasters and things like that, and we rely on animals to make sure that we have a stable ecosystem.",8,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"Makes sure that like plants get pollinated, make sure that like the small animals can eat the plants and those big animals can eat those and then we could eat those animals.",9,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,Obviously all those things are interconnected.,10,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,So conservation is really important.,11,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,So how do we increase conservation by increasing eco tourism?,12,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,And I think that the big thing here is that seeing is believing and seeing is supporting.,13,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,When you're directly seeing something you're probably more likely to be connected to it.,14,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"In the same way in that like if you directly know somebody who is like impacted by some kind of like problem, you're probably more likely to help them out than you are some stranger on the other side of the world.",15,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"The tangible human connection that is created when you're interacting with the environment that you would now be supporting, it means that you're probably more likely to be sympathetic.",16,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"You're gonna be more likely to be sympathetic in terms of like your political political positions, and terms of like your statements that you make and things like that, and also in terms of like financial support you'd give.",17,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"But on a more direct level, eco tourism can also have direct financial benefits.",18,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"Because the money that is being made off of like eco tourism, rather than just like going into the pockets of like larger corporations or things like that maybe, it can go into like local conservation movements, things like that, all pretty good things.",19,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,But additionally I also think that eco tourism should be increased because it's a pretty enjoyable way to travel.,20,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,An enjoyable way to spend your time.,21,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,There is proven scientific research that shows that spending more time in nature is incredibly good for your mental health.,22,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"It's why people recommended that like even if you have a plant in your house, that's like a pretty good thing, but it's also really good to just get up and go outside, get some sunlight, things like that.",23,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"And especially when you're in nature, something that is incredibly serene, incredibly calming.",24,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,That can be incredibly beneficial for you.,25,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,You're probably going to enjoy yourself.,26,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,So if you increase it people are more people are going to get this enjoyable experience which is good.,27,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"It also means that yeah, it also means that you're going to get to get all the benefits that are accrued, because it's also possible because of climate change that the environment isn't going to be the way it is forever.",28,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,And that's a really big problem because if you really want to get like a unique tourist experience you should probably go for the thing that isn't going to be there as long.,29,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"The eiffel tower probably isn't going anywhere over the next one hundred years or so, but like are really fragile rainforest may not be true.",30,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"It may get cut down by a commercial logging company, it may get destroyed by a hurricane or something.",31,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"Who or a wildfire, who knows what's going to happen.",32,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"So you should definitely increase eco tourism, appreciate the environment more.",33,,
DJ_3292_ecotourism_pro.trs.txt,"And for all those reasons, proud to propose.",34,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"We should not end international aid because international aid is incredibly important on a moral level, on a political level, and it doesn't come with that many costs so it's definitely worth it.",1,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why international aid is so important and I think that the biggest way is that honestly I think to some extent there's a moral obligation to give out international aid.,2,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,When you look around the world you see a lot of people who are a lot less fortunate than than countries than people who live in a place like america.,3,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,You see around the world people who live off of like our dollars dollars a day compared to what people in america live off of.,4,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"You see widespread food insecurity, you see not a whole lot of health and health infrastructure a lack of safety in a lot of contexts and things like that.",5,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And one of the biggest ways in which you can solve a lot of these problems is money because money is important.,6,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Money can buy clean drink you can buy clean drinking water with money, you can buy like malaria nets with money, you can buy food and shelter with money.",7,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,International aid can be incredibly important and a tool for good to solve a lot of problems that people have on a day-to-day basis.,8,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So obviously it can do a whole lot of good.,9,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So why should we feel an obligation to do that?,10,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"And the big reason there is that a lot of countries are first in situations like this because of developed countries or western countries having, like, a legacy of imperialism and colonialism that led to taking advantage of this.",11,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"whether it was the literal, like stripping land of resources and enslaving, enslavement of people, that led to the current global order that we see today, where western countries have a disproportionate control over resources and a disproportionate control over wealth, or whether it was like using intergovernmental financing agencies, whether it was the world trade organization or the IMF or similar entity, the world bank, in order to essentially force developing countries to accommodate western corporations to the largest extent possible,",12,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,so that western corporations could enrich themselves in their home countries while doing minimal good for the people who actually live in these countries and where the resources actually are,13,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,I feel like to a large extent the reason why there's a lot of problems in the world is because of the actions that were taken by western countries so they definitely should be giving aid almost as a form of reparations to help prevent that.,14,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,But I also think that on a political level this is simply just a good thing to do.,15,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Nothing builds up political will better, nothing makes the people on the ground happier and more willing to cooperate with you, than to help them solve the problems financially.",16,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"When you look at the way things are now in the world, the reason why we have such a strong alliance with countries throughout europe- a strong alliance with places like japan, a strong alliance with other countries- that we obviously bomb the crap out of them during world war two, completely burn down most of their cities.",17,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,why don't these countries hate us?,18,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"because, after we did that, we help them rebuild, we gave them large amounts of international aid, whether it's the marshall plan or similar plans- and what this did is it resulted in a progression of these countries economies.",19,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"and when you look at places nowadays- whether it's places in africa or, more prominently, places in the middle east that we've bombed- you look at these places that we're not giving them a level of help, so we're not doing a whole lot in order to make their lives better.",20,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,so I think that's a clear problem there.,21,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And I think that we can see a lot of problems get solved and a lot of political goodwill being brought up if this were to be implemented.,22,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,But finally I think that this is really cheap.,23,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"It's really cheap because it's it's just not that big of a part of our budget whether it's when you compare it to things like our military budget, our domestic healthcare spending budget, or things like that, the amount of money that gets spent on international aid is pennies on the dollar really not a whole lot of money.",24,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So a lot of these benefits can be for low amounts of money so it's definitely worth it.,25,,
DJ_3628_international-aid_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, do not end international aid.",26,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,We should decrease drug testing.,1,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,We should substantially decrease drug testing.,2,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And the first reason why we should do that is because it's a ridiculous thing to do and it's completely ineffective.,3,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So if you actually look at scientific evidence about what causes drug addiction oftentimes, a lot of times it's just based on like biological addiction, trying substances and becoming dependent on them.",4,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And moreover it's oftentimes also because the circumstance that people live in.,5,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,A lot of people that are addicted to drugs are doing so to get over some kind of deep pain or doing so as a way of escaping a life that isn't really a very good life.,6,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"A lot of times it's people who are in poverty, people who are homeless, people who are veterans who are faced with post traumatic stress disorder, people who are trying to escape from other mental health problems that isn't being sufficiently funded are treated, oftentimes this is the root of a whole lot of drug abuse in our country.",7,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So you know what's a really good way to make that problem a whole lot worse?,8,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Because now people can't try out for a sports team because they fail a drug test or they can't be a part of a club or an extracurricular activity because they failed a drug test.,9,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So you're probably more likely to socially isolate that person, make sure that person is more likely to maybe do something that's bad, more likely to something to do something like join like a drug trade or something like that.",10,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,How about depriving people of economic opportunity?,11,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Because people who smoke weed or do molly every once in a while or have taken shrooms before or whatever people do sometimes as a recreation on their weekends, because people are you deprive them of economic opportunity just because people live their life in a certain way.",12,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"That also seems like a really good way of making sure that people are only going to feel more depressed, that people are going to feel worse about themselves.",13,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And you are probably going to only further fuel a cycle of drug addiction and abuse.,14,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"So I really feel like if your goal is to really like stop people from doing drugs, you want to encourage people to actually get help.",15,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,You want to encourage people to get treatment.,16,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"And a really horrible way of doing that is just further building up stigmas, further socially isolating people and further depriving people of economic opportunity.",17,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And all that's going to happen because of drugs tests.,18,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"This isn't a matter of like: "" oh well you know on drug addicts doing like various kinds of jobs blah blah blah blah blah "".",19,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Like if you're doing drugs during work and you're doing a bad job then that's like a separate reason for you to fire somebody.,20,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,But drug tests are designed in such a way to essentially police what people are doing outside of the workplace or the sports team or whatever context they're being used in.,21,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Which brings me to the next point of discussion which is that this is a horrible violation of people's basic liberty to live their life in the way that they want to do.,22,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Because I think that, when you're talking about some drugs maybe like heroin or cocaine, maybe it's worthwhile to talk about drug addiction and the serious harms that this does to people.",23,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,But there's also a whole lot of drugs that are criminalized that aren't necessarily all that bad and we shouldn't really judge people or deprive them of an ability to use them.,24,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"The obvious example is marijuana which is still criminalized by the federal government in america in most of the states and is also criminal in most of the world, and it's obviously something that isn't really worthy of our time even.",25,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,It's not worthy of the money and it certainly worthy of the moral condemnation.,26,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,Because people have the right to do things that don't really hurt anybody else.,27,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,And if you're talking about different things.,28,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"Whether it's like hallucinogenic mushrooms or LSD or Molly or ecstasy at a party or something like that, oftentimes you can have opinions about whether or not you want to do it, opinions about whether or not you think that it's a good thing maybe, but at the end of the day this is other people's bodies in this is other people's minds.",29,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,"And if there's anything that we should have control over, it's our minds and our bodies and we should be able to do what we want with them.",30,,
DJ_3648_drug-testing_con_RG_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should not have drug testing.,31,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not ban reality tv because doing so is an obvious violation of freedom of speech and freedom of expression.,1,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And beyond that it's also an incredibly ridiculous idea.,2,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why this is just illegal and it's a violation of free speech and expression.,3,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And there's a couple of reasons for this: and first it's because this is self expression is an incredibly important form of protected speech in terms of like constitutional law and there's reasons for that.,4,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Speech doesn't have to be political to have value.,5,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Speech can be important culturally, artistically, etcetera.",6,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And that's important because there's more to life and there is more to things that are valuable than just simply politics.,7,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And oftentimes these things are intertwined with one another anyway, because the way in which we express ourselves in a non neutral way in a public setting via like a TV show or something like that, is an important way in which we express who we are and express our identities and that's obviously an incredibly important thing to individual people.",8,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,So that's why we have protections in place for things like that.,9,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But beyond that, I also think that this is just an illegal action.",10,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because this is clearly content based like targeted discrimination, amongst like a particular group.",11,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"So when you're trying to like like one of the biggest no no's in terms of freedom of speech is basically the government or the state, as like a when they're trying to ban speech, doesn't get to just pick and choose what speech it likes and what speech it doesn't like.",12,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Because it basically gives rise to like the definition of prejudice in that the government gets to decide what the narrative is, the government gets to decide what's acceptable for a population to listen to, and that's absolutely ridiculous because that's not how it should work.",13,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,The people get to decide what they want to hear.,14,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And if you don't want to listen to something then you just turn it off or you block it or something like that.,15,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"But that doesn't mean that something shouldn't be accessible to people who want to see it, who wants to enjoy it.",16,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And that goes into the final thing that I'm going to talk about, which is why this is just an absolutely ridiculous thing.",17,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And the first thing is that this is going to piss off a lot of people because a lot of people like reality TV and for good reason.,18,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Reality TV isn't merely the scapegoat of like jersey shores, something like that, where it's seen as just like a plague on our society in terms of like stupidity.",19,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,It's an incredibly diverse area and there's like a huge niches to it.,20,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like you could have like like rupaul's drag race, you could have like cutthroat kitchen, like you have like skin wars, you have obviously things like the jersey shore too.",21,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Like there's literally endless ways of reality TV shows.,22,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,And a lot of different people get different kinds of pleasure out of it because it's such a diverse genre.,23,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And just trying to say as like a blanket: "" all reality TV is bad.",24,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"All reality TV is worthy of the same condemnation. """,25,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,Because it's an incredibly diverse genre that a whole lot of people enjoy.,26,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"And that goes into the last thing, which is that this isn't going to solve anything.",27,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"Any argument against reality TV, that you could be doing something else that's more productive, that it that it's actively bad because it's like a drain on like society's brains or something like that, there's always going to be some kind of alternative that's just as bad if not worse.",28,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,There's an endless way in like a technological age for people distract themselves with silly things.,29,,
DJ_3702_reality-television_con_JL_implicit.trs.txt,"If it's not going to be reality TV it's going to be something else, so do not ban reality TV.",30,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We should decrease government regulation because government regulation is bad for business and of course since it's bad for business it's also bad for the people and the economy.,1,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why government regulation is bad for business and of course there is a myriad of ways in which government regulation is bad for business.,2,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So the the first of which is that there is direct harms that government regulation has cost the business.,3,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So there is costs in complying with government regulations whether it's hiring people who are constantly abreast of and informed of the myriad of government regulations that you have to be following, whether it's like paying for legal departments in compliance offices, paying for like legal staff in the event that you break a some kind of regulation and you now you need to deal with it.",4,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So there's like all kinds of like direct ways in which government regulations just like spend more businesses money.,5,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But beyond that there's also indirect ways in which government regulations hurt business revenues because they restrict the abilities of like businesses to make money.,6,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So whether it's things like like establishing like like maybe a price parameter, or establishing some kind of like restriction on like what materials you can put in a product, maybe like you can't use these cheaper materials you have to use the more expensive materials or like whatever the regulation is.",7,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,They generally like add additional cost of business in like in terms of an opportunity cost by like it takes away the ability to do cheaper alternatives maybe.,8,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It like adds on even more cost to businesses.,9,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So why do we care about making things more expensive for businesses?,10,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Why is it bad that businesses are more expensive?,11,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So there's obviously a lot of reasons.,12,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So like first and foremost, when businesses have to spend more money on like random government regulations that's money that's not being invested in the growth of the business which is obviously not good.",13,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Beyond it not be invested in growth it's also not being invested in possibly employees.,14,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It can't be invested in hiring and more jobs.,15,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It can't be invested in increasing wages and things like that because the more financial stress you put on a and beyond that is also the final thing is that a lot of the prices are likely to get passed on to consumers.,16,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So like consumer products are gonna be more expensive because of government regulation.,17,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So all of that is bad.,18,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"When like you make it more expensive for businesses to do business, employees are worse off, employers are worse off, and consumers are worse off.",19,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So all of that's like super super bad.,20,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But beyond that, it's not even necessary to increase government regulation.",21,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We already have enough government regulation as it is.,22,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"We certainly don't need more, especially because, of course, the free market is self-regulating.",23,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"and the free market is self-regulating because if, like the government regulation, let's say like there's some shitty thing or shady thing that a corporation is doing that the government doesn't like, then the people can use the most important power that they have, the power of their wallet and the power of the market- to stop going to that business.",24,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"and that means that, like, that business will have to stop doing it.",25,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So like an example of this could be like maybe like people don't like high fructose corn syrup or whatever, people just prefer regular sugar.",26,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So like you don't need a government regulation to mandate against high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar.,27,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,If people prefer something they can use their like market power to like express that concern with the power of their wallet.,28,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So like in a lot of ways government regulations their just like flat out unnecessary.,29,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Markets are self-regulating and self-correcting.,30,,
DJ_3718_government-regulation_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all of those reasons, we should not increase government regulation.",31,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not end censorship because ending censorship is bad because there are some things that should be censored.,1,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about some of these cases.,2,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Some of them are really obvious.,3,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"There's things like classified information or information that could be detrimental to national security that you want to make sure that you have an ability to censor, because it could mean that national security could be at risk, lives of soldiers or spies or other people could be at risk.",4,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Moreover there's also things like libel or slander that obviously you should be able to censor if if needed.,5,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Things that can like really like hurt people's lives, you can do damage to people in such a way in which there's no real legitimate base of the speech because you're hurting another person.",6,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It's not the same as just like a form of expression.,7,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,You're trying to hurt another person.,8,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And it's for similar reasons that things like incitement can be censored.,9,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"If you're trying to like incite and overthrow the government, inciting violence against some kind of official maybe, or like an individual person.",10,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Obviously that's just another situation in which censorship can exist as well.,11,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"And finally there's things like hate speech, where there's legitimate reasons for censorship there as well.",12,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"When you're trying to make people feel unsafe, when you're trying to make people feel unwelcome, when your when you're a political when your like speech, when your expression can come at the expense of other people by making them feel unsafe in in expressing themselves and speaking out, then you make it so that really you in a lot of ways forfeit your right to speech.",13,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So those are just some examples of circumstances under which a censorship can be acceptable.,14,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So obviously censorship shouldn't like always be the case, you don't want to censor everything, but ending censorship will necessarily entail losing out on things that maybe you should censor.",15,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Selective things that should be censored like all of these things and possibly others as well.,16,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,But beyond that I also think that we can reasonably trust government actors to be responsible in how they actually conduct themselves when they're deciding what to censor and what not to censor.,17,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,When you're talking about like democratic societies for example there's a lot of powerful institutions that are in place that exists as checks.,18,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So whether it's like the internet or third parties, the media, or things like that, a lot of stuff gets out anyway.",19,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So if you're trying to censor things that are like really major events or trying to censor like political opposition or things like that you're probably not gonna be able to do that.,20,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Like large scale censorship of the likes of which you see in places like china and north korea are simply not feasible, simply not likely to happen.",21,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that it's very unlikely that you're gonna be able to see it get abused all that much.,22,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And furthermore there is also a very like powerful norms of freedom of speech in a lot of countries.,23,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So like for example you go to places like germany where the holocaust denial is something that you can be put in jail for.,24,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,That's obviously a form of censorship but at the same time we don't see like the german state just saying like oh well we're also going to censor you if you say that like you think that we should have a different kind of economic policy rather than what like as opposed to what angela merkel thinks.,25,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And the reason for that is because like there's like like reasonably strong institutions in place that prioritize freedom of speech.,26,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,That it's like in a lot of cases a really important thing.,27,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So we're going to protect it many circumstances, just not all circumstances.",28,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,And the people can help with accountability in that in a democratic society.,29,,
DJ_3726_censorship_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So for all those reasons we should not end censorship.,30,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We should not have mandatory community service because it's unfair to the individuals who would have to participate in the community service and it's also just like a generally bad social practice.,1,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So let's start by talking about why community service is problematic when its forced.,2,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So I think that the biggest reason is that by and large this would likely be forced labor.,3,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,It would probably be unpaid labor as well and it would happen at periods of people's lives when they often need to be making money the most.,4,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,When people are graduating from high school or graduating from college odds are they have the least amount of experience in the workplace but they also have a high degree of debt from like college or things like that so they're in like a rather economically coercive situation and really need all the money they can make.,5,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Odds are these community service jobs are probably not going to pay anything at all in a lot of cases which is an absolutely horrible thing.,6,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,At most they might pay a literal like a living stipend but even that is just really not a whole lot of money and moreover it also can be a huge burden on a lot of people compared to what they could be making.,7,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So if somebody could be making more money and using that to pay off debts pay off or save money for like retirement and things like that and get started earlier, all those are like really really good things that we should be encouraging and we shouldn;t be making it harder for people to make money and grow and develop in society.",8,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"But, moreover, this also hurts people,",9,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because these are like prime years in which you should be getting experience in a given industry that you want to work in and oftentimes, like, if you don't want to do work in, like the public sector, and especially",10,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because oftentimes like there's probably not going, there's going to be",11,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"so much choice, you're going to have over where your community service will be, especially if it's mandatory",12,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"certain kinds of jobs will likely be much more popular than others, so odds are that you'll probably have, like you'll more likely be assigned to jobs rather than able to pick jobs.",13,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,So you maybe taking some pure prime wage earning years and prime skill building years doing something that is really completely useless for your further life.,14,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So that's really like unfair to the individual as well, but moreover I also think that this is as like a second point a pretty immoral practice for a couple of reasons.",15,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,First because I think that you shouldn't have to support the government necessarily if you don't want to.,16,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,We already give support to the government in terms of financial support so we don't owe the government anything else.,17,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"We pay for the services that we use in the form of taxes,",18,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"so the the duty that we have to the government is already satisfied,",19,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"but our literal bodies and our jobs and our ability to earn money is simply too far,",20,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"because that's like a huge, huge part of of like who you are and when that can be and when the government has a right to restrict your employment opportunities in stricture, restricts your ability to make money, restrict what you can do with your life in such extreme ways and force you to do what you don't may not want to do with your life in such a way that could be hugely immoral",21,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,Especially if the job could be something that you simply don't believe it like a job like aiding maybe ICE like immigrations and customs enforcement or the military or something like that which you may not find moral.,22,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So that's a really big problem, but finally I also think that this is really bad for the society in which it's going to be enacted anyway.",23,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"Keep in mind that these are likely going to be less qualified people, less experienced people and people who aren't going to, in a lot of cases, want to do the jobs they have to do",24,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,because they're forced to do,25,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"so, and I think that likely you'll see lower productivity, lower levels of effort, lower levels of care and service for these, for these jobs, and, moreover, they're also only going to be short term",26,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,they're not going to be long enough term that you're going to really be able to build up experience with these people.,27,,
DJ_3730_community-service_con_TL_implicit.trs.txt,"So for all those reasons, no mandatory community service.",28,,
