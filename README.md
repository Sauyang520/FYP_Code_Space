These scripts recorded my journey of creating a debate analyser system, including data collection, eda, processing, transfer learning, modelling, and evaluation.
The processed datasets are also attached.
Due to size limitation, only the selected model, DeBERTa-v3 argument type classifier is uploaded to Huggung Face: https://huggingface.co/Sauyang/argument-labelling-deberta-v3
